Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is highly related to a variety of atopic diseases, and 
several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have demonstrated the 
association between genes and IgE. In this study, we conducted the largest 
genome-wide association study of IgE in a Taiwanese Han population. A total of 8 
independent variants showed genome-wide significance, and rs147642819 at 6p21.32 
was the most significant signal (p = 1.8 × 10-19). Among them, an intronic SNP 
of CD28, rs1181388, and an intergenic SNP, rs1002957030, on 11q23.2 were 
identified as novel signals for IgE. Seven of the loci were replicated 
successfully after a meta-analysis of the Japanese population. Among all the 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions, HLA-DQA1*03:02 - HLA-DQB1*03:03 was the 
most significant haplotype (OR = 1.25, SE = 0.02, FDR = 1.6 × 10-14), 
corresponding to HLA-DQA1 Asp160 and HLA-DQB1 Leu87 amino residues. The genetic 
correlation showed significance between IgE and allergic diseases including 
asthma, atopic dermatitis, and pollinosis. The IgE PRS significantly correlated 
with the total IgE level. Furthermore, the top 10 quantile IgE polygenic risk 
score (PRS) group had a potentially higher risk for asthma, which was also 
replicated in the Taiwan Biobank and Japanese populations. IgE PRS may be used 
to aid in predicting the occurrence of allergic reactions before symptoms occur 
and biomarkers are detectable. Our study provided a more comprehensive 
understanding of the impact of genomic variants on serum IgE.

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is responsible for many childhood cancers in sub-Saharan 
Africa, where it is linked to recurrent or chronic infection by Epstein-Barr 
virus or Plasmodium falciparum. However, whether human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
polymorphisms, which regulate immune response, are associated with BL has not 
been well investigated, which limits our understanding of BL etiology. Here we 
investigate this association among 4,645 children aged 0-15 years, 800 with BL, 
enrolled in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Malawi. HLA alleles are imputed with 
accuracy >90% for HLA class I and 85-89% for class II alleles. BL risk is 
elevated with HLA-DQA1*04:01 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.32-1.97, P = 3.71 × 10-6), with rs2040406(G) in HLA-DQA1 
region (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.26-1.63, P = 4.62 × 10-8), and with amino acid Gln 
at position 53 versus other variants in HLA-DQA1 (OR = 1.36, P = 2.06 × 10-6). 
The associations with HLA-DQA1*04:01 (OR = 1.29, P = 0.03) and rs2040406(G) 
(OR = 1.68, P = 0.019) persist in mutually adjusted models. The higher risk 
rs2040406(G) variant for BL is associated with decreased HLA-DQB1 expression in 
eQTLs in EBV transformed lymphocytes. Our results support the role of HLA 
variation in the etiology of BL and suggest that a promising area of research 
might be understanding the link between HLA variation and EBV control.

BACKGROUND: The modulation of the activity disease in patients with Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS) that occurs during pregnancy is a helpful model which could 
provide insight into central disease mechanisms and facilitate treatment. 
Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify differentially expressed genes 
in-silico to perform biological function pathway enrichment analysis and 
protein-protein interaction from pregnant women with MS.
METHODS: Transcriptome data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. We selected the microarray dataset GSE17449. The gene expression 
dataset contains the data of mononuclear cells from four different groups 
sought, including seven healthy women (H), four healthy pregnant women (HP), 
eight women with multiple sclerosis (WMS), and nine women nine months pregnant 
with multiple sclerosis (PMS). The GSEA software was employed for enrichment 
analysis, and the REACTOME database was used for biological pathways. The 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was plotted with STRING. The databases 
used to identify the connection of DEGs with different signaling pathways were 
KEGG and WIKIPATHWAYS.
RESULTS: We identified 42 differentially expressed genes in pregnant women with 
MS. The significant pathways included IL-10 signaling pathway, ErbB2 activates, 
the hemoglobin complex (HBD, HBB, HBA1, AHSP, and HBA2), IL-17 signaling pathway 
(LCN2 and MMP9), antigen processing and presentation, and Th17 cell 
differentiation (HLA-DQA1), Rap1 signaling pathway (ID1), NOD-Like receptor 
signaling pathway (CAMP and DEFA4), PD-L1 Signaling, Interferon gamma signaling 
(MMP9 and ARG1), Neutrophil degranulation (CAMP, DEFA4, ELANE, CEACAM8, S100P, 
CHI3L1, AZU1, OLFM4, CRISP3, LTF, ARG1, PGLYRP1, and TCN1). In the WIKIPATHWAYS 
set, significance was found Vitamin B12 metabolism (TCN1, HBB, and HBA2), and 
IL-18 signaling pathway (S100P).
CONCLUSION: This study can be used to understand several essential target genes 
and pathways identified in the present study, which may serve as feasible 
targets for MS therapies.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are important in many immune 
processes and contribute to many adverse drug reactions. Whether genetic 
variations in the HLA region are associated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity remains uncertain. Therefore, the aim of our study 
was to identify HLA genetic variations in patients with NSAID hypersensitivity 
in the Taiwanese population.
METHODS: This hospital-based, retrospective case-control study enrolled 37,156 
participants with NSAID exposure from the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative 
(TPMI), who were all genotyped and imputed to fine map HLA typing. Our study 
assigned 1217 cases to the NSAID allergy group and 12,170 controls to a matched 
group. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to explore associations 
between HLA alleles and NSAID hypersensitivity.
RESULTS: Overall, 13,387 patients were genotyped for eight major HLA alleles. 
Allele frequencies were different between the two groups. In the NSAID allergy 
group, the genotype frequencies of HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*34:01, and HLA-DQA1*06:01 
were found to be markedly elevated compared to the control group, a significance 
that persisted even after applying the Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, the 
risk of NSAID allergy demonstrated a significant association with HLA-A*02:01 
(OR = 1.29, p < 0.001) and HLA-A*34:01 (OR = 9.90, p = 0.001), in comparison to 
their respective counterparts. Notably, the genotype frequency of HLA-B*46:01 
exhibited a significant increase in the severe allergy group when compared with 
the mild allergy group.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified HLA genotypes linked to the onset and severity of 
NSAID hypersensitivity. Our findings establish a basis for precision 
prescription in future clinical applications.

Gout commonly manifests as a painful, self-limiting inflammatory arthritis. 
Nevertheless, the understanding of the inflammatory and immune responses 
underlying gout flares and remission remains ambiguous. Here, based on 
single-cell RNA-Seq and an independent validation cohort, we identified the 
potential mechanism of gout flare, which likely involves the upregulation of 
HLA-DQA1+ nonclassical monocytes and is related to antigen processing and 
presentation. Furthermore, Tregs also play an essential role in the suppressive 
capacity during gout remission. Cell communication analysis suggested the 
existence of altered crosstalk between monocytes and other T cell types, such as 
Tregs. Moreover, we observed the systemic upregulation of inflammatory and 
cytokine genes, primarily in classical monocytes, during gout flares. All 
monocyte subtypes showed increased arachidonic acid metabolic activity along 
with upregulation of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). We also 
detected a decrease in blood arachidonic acid and an increase in leukotriene B4 
levels during gout flares. In summary, our study illustrates the distinctive 
immune cell responses and systemic inflammation patterns that characterize the 
transition from gout flares to remission, and it suggests that blood monocyte 
subtypes and Tregs are potential intervention targets for preventing recurrent 
gout attacks and progression.
