BACKGROUND: The modulation of the activity disease in patients with Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS) that occurs during pregnancy is a helpful model which could 
provide insight into central disease mechanisms and facilitate treatment. 
Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify differentially expressed genes 
in-silico to perform biological function pathway enrichment analysis and 
protein-protein interaction from pregnant women with MS.
METHODS: Transcriptome data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. We selected the microarray dataset GSE17449. The gene expression 
dataset contains the data of mononuclear cells from four different groups 
sought, including seven healthy women (H), four healthy pregnant women (HP), 
eight women with multiple sclerosis (WMS), and nine women nine months pregnant 
with multiple sclerosis (PMS). The GSEA software was employed for enrichment 
analysis, and the REACTOME database was used for biological pathways. The 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was plotted with STRING. The databases 
used to identify the connection of DEGs with different signaling pathways were 
KEGG and WIKIPATHWAYS.
RESULTS: We identified 42 differentially expressed genes in pregnant women with 
MS. The significant pathways included IL-10 signaling pathway, ErbB2 activates, 
the hemoglobin complex (HBD, HBB, HBA1, AHSP, and HBA2), IL-17 signaling pathway 
(LCN2 and MMP9), antigen processing and presentation, and Th17 cell 
differentiation (HLA-DQA1), Rap1 signaling pathway (ID1), NOD-Like receptor 
signaling pathway (CAMP and DEFA4), PD-L1 Signaling, Interferon gamma signaling 
(MMP9 and ARG1), Neutrophil degranulation (CAMP, DEFA4, ELANE, CEACAM8, S100P, 
CHI3L1, AZU1, OLFM4, CRISP3, LTF, ARG1, PGLYRP1, and TCN1). In the WIKIPATHWAYS 
set, significance was found Vitamin B12 metabolism (TCN1, HBB, and HBA2), and 
IL-18 signaling pathway (S100P).
CONCLUSION: This study can be used to understand several essential target genes 
and pathways identified in the present study, which may serve as feasible 
targets for MS therapies.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are important in many immune 
processes and contribute to many adverse drug reactions. Whether genetic 
variations in the HLA region are associated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity remains uncertain. Therefore, the aim of our study 
was to identify HLA genetic variations in patients with NSAID hypersensitivity 
in the Taiwanese population.
METHODS: This hospital-based, retrospective case-control study enrolled 37,156 
participants with NSAID exposure from the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative 
(TPMI), who were all genotyped and imputed to fine map HLA typing. Our study 
assigned 1217 cases to the NSAID allergy group and 12,170 controls to a matched 
group. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to explore associations 
between HLA alleles and NSAID hypersensitivity.
RESULTS: Overall, 13,387 patients were genotyped for eight major HLA alleles. 
Allele frequencies were different between the two groups. In the NSAID allergy 
group, the genotype frequencies of HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*34:01, and HLA-DQA1*06:01 
were found to be markedly elevated compared to the control group, a significance 
that persisted even after applying the Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, the 
risk of NSAID allergy demonstrated a significant association with HLA-A*02:01 
(OR = 1.29, p < 0.001) and HLA-A*34:01 (OR = 9.90, p = 0.001), in comparison to 
their respective counterparts. Notably, the genotype frequency of HLA-B*46:01 
exhibited a significant increase in the severe allergy group when compared with 
the mild allergy group.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified HLA genotypes linked to the onset and severity of 
NSAID hypersensitivity. Our findings establish a basis for precision 
prescription in future clinical applications.

Gout commonly manifests as a painful, self-limiting inflammatory arthritis. 
Nevertheless, the understanding of the inflammatory and immune responses 
underlying gout flares and remission remains ambiguous. Here, based on 
single-cell RNA-Seq and an independent validation cohort, we identified the 
potential mechanism of gout flare, which likely involves the upregulation of 
HLA-DQA1+ nonclassical monocytes and is related to antigen processing and 
presentation. Furthermore, Tregs also play an essential role in the suppressive 
capacity during gout remission. Cell communication analysis suggested the 
existence of altered crosstalk between monocytes and other T cell types, such as 
Tregs. Moreover, we observed the systemic upregulation of inflammatory and 
cytokine genes, primarily in classical monocytes, during gout flares. All 
monocyte subtypes showed increased arachidonic acid metabolic activity along 
with upregulation of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). We also 
detected a decrease in blood arachidonic acid and an increase in leukotriene B4 
levels during gout flares. In summary, our study illustrates the distinctive 
immune cell responses and systemic inflammation patterns that characterize the 
transition from gout flares to remission, and it suggests that blood monocyte 
subtypes and Tregs are potential intervention targets for preventing recurrent 
gout attacks and progression.

OBJECTIVE: Novel autoantibody specificities including anti-CCAR1 were recently 
discovered in adult patients with anti-TIF1γ-positive dermatomyositis (DM) and 
were associated with attenuated cancer emergence. The aims of the present study 
were to examine whether these autoantibodies occur in patients with 
juvenile-onset dermatomyositis (JDM) and to determine their associated features.
METHODS: Sera from 150 patients with anti-TIF1γ autoantibody-positive JDM in a 
cross-sectional cohort and 90 juvenile healthy controls were assayed for 
anti-CCAR1, anti-C1Z1, anti-IMMT, anti-TBL1XR1, and anti-Sp4 autoantibodies. 
Demographics, myositis autoantibodies, clinical features, medications, outcomes, 
and HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 alleles were compared between those with and without 
these autoantibodies.
RESULTS: Any one of the anti-TIF1γ-associated autoantibodies was present in 44 
(29%) patients overall, including 25 (17%) with anti-Sp4, 22 (15%) with 
anti-TBL1XR1, 14 (9%) with anti-CCAR1, 2 (1%) with anti-C1Z1, and 2 (1%) with 
anti-IMMT autoantibodies. These anti-TIF1γ-associated autoantibodies frequently 
co-occurred. Patients with any of the anti-TIF1γ-associated autoantibodies had 
less frequent falling (34% [15] vs 53% [56], p=0.032) and lower peak muscle 
enzymes. None of the patients had cancer. Among White patients, HLA-DRB1*03 was 
protective against an anti-TIF1γ-associated autoantibody (OR 0.20, 95% CI 
0.07-0.52).
CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies associated with anti-TIF1γ were found in isolation 
and in combination among a subset of patients with JDM. Patients with these 
autoantibodies had less severe muscle disease and were not enriched for 
HLA-DRB1*03. Additional autoantibodies among anti-TIF1γ-positive patients with 
JDM likely contribute to the heterogeneity of the anti-TIF1γ serologic subgroup.

    medRxiv. 2023 Mar 20;:

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus plays a critical role in complex traits 
spanning autoimmune and infectious diseases, transplantation and cancer. While 
coding variation in HLA genes has been extensively documented, regulatory 
genetic variation modulating HLA expression levels has not been comprehensively 
investigated. Here we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 
classical HLA genes across 1,073 individuals and 1,131,414 single cells from 
three tissues. To mitigate technical confounding, we developed scHLApers, a 
pipeline to accurately quantify single-cell HLA expression using personalized 
reference genomes. We identified cell-type-specific cis-eQTLs for every 
classical HLA gene. Modeling eQTLs at single-cell resolution revealed that many 
eQTL effects are dynamic across cell states even within a cell type. HLA-DQ 
genes exhibit particularly cell-state-dependent effects within myeloid, B and T 
cells. For example, a T cell HLA-DQA1 eQTL ( rs3104371 ) is strongest in 
cytotoxic cells. Dynamic HLA regulation may underlie important interindividual 
variability in immune responses.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide. 
To prevent its spread, mRNA-based vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b1) 
and Moderna (mRNA-1273) have been widely used, including in Japan. Various 
adverse events have been reported following the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with 
differences observed among individuals. However, analyses of the genetic 
background associated with the susceptibility to side effects have been limited. 
In the present study, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 
self-reported adverse events of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in 4545 Japanese 
individuals and identified 14 associated loci. Among these, 6p21 was associated 
with 37.5 °C or higher fever, 38 °C or higher fever, and muscle pain. HLA allele 
association analysis revealed that various HLA alleles were associated with the 
adverse effects; HLA-DQA1*03:01 and HLA-A*11:01 were more reliably associated 
with the adverse effects. Our results may enable the preparation and management 
of adverse effects by identifying the susceptibility to these adverse events. 
Furthermore, we obtained valuable data that may lead to a better understanding 
of the mechanisms of action of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

OBJECTIVE: Lung adenocarcinoma (LA) is one of the most common malignancies and 
is responsible for the greatest number of tumor-related deaths. Our research 
aimed to explore the molecular subtype signatures of LA to clarify the 
correlation among the immune microenvironment, clinical outcomes, and 
therapeutic response.
METHODS: The LA immune cell marker genes (LICMGs) identified by single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis were used to discriminate the molecular subtypes 
and homologous immune and metabolic traits of GSE72094 LA cases. In addition, 
the model-building genes were identified from 1441 LICMGs by Cox-regression 
analysis, and a LA immune difference score (LIDscore) was developed to quantify 
individual differences in each patient, thereby predicting prognosis and 
susceptibility to immunotherapy and chemotherapy of LA patients.
RESULTS: Patients of the GSE72094 cohort were divided into two distinct 
molecular subtypes based on LICMGs: immune activating subtype (Cluster-C1) and 
metabolically activating subtype (cluster-C2). The two molecular subtypes have 
distinct characteristics regarding prognosis, clinicopathology, genomics, immune 
microenvironment, and response to immunotherapy. Among the LICMGs, LGR4, GOLM1, 
CYP24A1, SFTPB, COL1A1, HLA-DQA1, MS4A7, PPARG, and IL7R were enrolled to 
construct a LIDscore model. Low-LIDscore patients had a higher survival rate due 
to abundant immune cell infiltration, activated immunity, and lower genetic 
variation, but probably the higher levels of Treg cells in the immune 
microenvironment lead to immune cell dysfunction and promote tumor immune 
escape, thus decreasing the responsiveness to immunotherapy compared with that 
of the high-LIDscore patients. Overall, high-LIDscore patients had a higher 
responsiveness to immunotherapy and a higher sensitivity to chemotherapy than 
the low-LIDscore group.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular subtypes based on LICMGs provided a promising strategy 
for predicting patient prognosis, biological characteristics, and immune 
microenvironment features. In addition, they helped identify the patients most 
likely to benefit from immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Helicobacter pylori was reported as an important cause of gastritis, and gastric 
ulcers and CagA oncoprotein-producing H. pylori subgroups were blamed to 
increase the severity of gastritis. Disparities were reported in that the 
presence of serum anti-CagA IgA was not parallel with CagA-positive H. pylori 
cohabitation. We hypothesized that the HLA-DQA1 ~ DQB1 haplotypes in human 
populations include protective haplotypes that more effectively present 
immunogenic CagA peptides and susceptible haplotypes with an impaired capacity 
to present CagA peptides. We recruited patients (n = 201) admitted for 
gastroendoscopy procedures and performed high-resolution HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 
typing. Serum anti-CagA IgA levels were analyzed by ELISA (23.0% positive), and 
H. pylori was classified as positive or negative in gastric mucosal tissue 
slides (72.6% positive). The HLA DQA1*05:05 allele (29.1%) and HLA DQB1*03:01 
allele (32.8%) were found at the highest frequency among gastritis patients of 
Turkish descent. In HLA DQA1*05:05 ~ DQB1*03:01 double homozygous (7.3%) and 
heterozygous (40.7%) haplotype carriers, the presence of anti-CagA IgA decreased 
dramatically, the presence of H. pylori increased, and the presence of 
metaplasia followed a decreasing trend. The DQ protein encoded by HLA 
DQA1*05:05-DQ*03:01 showed a low binding affinity to the CagA peptide when 
binding capacity was analyzed by the NetMHCIIPan 4.0 prediction method. In 
conclusion, HLA DQA1 ~ DQB1 polymorphisms are crucial as host defense mechanisms 
against CagA H. pylori since antigen binding capacity plays a crucial role in 
anti-CagA IgA production.
