INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is responsible for more than 70 000 and 500 000 
maternal and fetal deaths, respectively each year. Incomplete remodelling of the 
spiral arteries in placenta is the most accepted theory of preeclampsia 
pathogenesis. However, the process is complexed with immunological background, 
as pregnancy resembles allograft transplantation. Fetus expresses human 
leukocyte antigens (HLA) inherited from both parents, thus is semiallogeneic to 
the maternal immune system. Therefore, induction of fetal tolerance is crucial 
for physiological outcome of pregnancy. Noteworthy, the immunogenicity of 
discordant HLA antigens is determined by functional epitopes called eplets, 
which are continuous and discontinuous short sequences of amino acids. This way 
various HLA molecules may express the same eplet and some HLA incompatibilities 
can be more immunogenic due to different eplet combination. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that maternal- fetal HLA incompatibility may be involved in the 
pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and its progression to preeclampsia. We 
also aimed to test if particular maternal-fetal eplet mismatches are more prone 
for induction of anti- fetal HLA antibodies in gestational hypertension and 
preeclampsia.
METHODS: High resolution next-generation sequencing of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and 
-DRB1 antigens was performed in mothers and children from physiological 
pregnancies (12 pairs) and from pregnancies complicated with gestational 
hypertension (22 pairs) and preeclampsia (27 pairs). In the next step HLA eplet 
identification and analysis of HLA eplet incompatibilities was performed with in 
silico approach HLAMatchmaker algorithm. Simultaneously maternal sera were 
screened for anti-fetal HLA class I, class II and anti-MICA antibodies with 
Luminex, and data were analyzed with HLA-Fusion software.
RESULTS: We observed that high HLA-C, -B, and DQB1 maternal-fetal eplet 
compatibility was associated with severe preeclampsia (PE) manifestation. Both 
quantity and quality of HLA epletmismatches affected the severity of PE. 
Mismatches in HLA-B eplets: 65QIA+76ESN, 70IAO, 180E, HLA-C eplets: 193PL3, 
267QE, and HLA-DRB1 eplet: 16Y were associated with a mild outcome of 
preeclampsia if the complication occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: High HLA-C, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B eplet compatibility between mother 
and child is associated with severe manifestation of preeclampsia. Both quantity 
and quality of maternal-fetal HLA eplet mismatches affects severity of 
preeclampsia.

The underlying genetic susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not yet 
fully understood. The heterogeneous nature of the disease challenges genetic 
association studies. Endophenotype approaches can help to address this challenge 
by more direct interrogation of biological traits related to the disease. AD 
endophenotypes based on amyloid-β, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers 
and cognitive performance were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 1565). A genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) of quantitative phenotypes was performed using an SNP main effect 
and an SNP by Diagnosis interaction (SNP × DX) model to identify disease 
stage-specific genetic effects. Nine loci were identified as study-wide 
significant with one or more A/T/N endophenotypes in the main effect model, as 
well as additional findings significantly associated with cognitive measures. 
These nine loci include SNPs in or near the genes APOE, SRSF10, HLA-DQB1, XKR3, 
and KIAA1671. The SNP × DX model identified three study-wide significant genetic 
loci (BACH2, EP300, and PACRG-AS1) with a neuroprotective effect in later AD 
stage endophenotypes. An endophenotype approach identified novel genetic 
associations and provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
genetic associations that may otherwise be missed using conventional 
case-control study designs.

A potential prognostic prediction model for metastatic osteosarcoma based on 
bioinformatics analysis.

Wang Y, Ming G, Gao B.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant primary bone tumor with a high incidence. This 
study aims to construct a prognostic prediction model by screening the 
prognostic mRNA of metastatic OS. Data on four eligible expression profiles from 
the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus 
repository were obtained based on inclusion criteria and defined as the training 
set or the validation set. The differentially expressed genres (DEGs) between 
meta- static and non-metastatic OS samples in the training set were first 
identified, and DEGs related to prognosis were screened by univariate Cox 
regression analysis. In total, 107 DEGs related to the prognosis of metastatic 
OS were identified. Then, 46 DEGs were isolated as the optimized prognostic gene 
signature, and a metastatic-OS discriminating classifier was constructed, which 
had a high accuracy in distinguishing metastatic from non-metastatic OS samples. 
Furthermore, four optimized prognostic gene signatures (ALOX5AP, COL21A1, 
HLA-DQB1, and LDHB) were further screened, and the prognostic prediction model 
for metastatic OS was constructed. This model possesses a relatively satisfying 
prediction ability both in the training set and validation set. The prognostic 
prediction model that was constructed based on the four prognostic mRNA 
signatures has a high predictive ability for the prognosis of metastatic OS.

HLA DR-DQ haplotypes largely define genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes 
(T1D). The DQB1*06:02 positive haplotype (DR15-DQ602) common in subjects of 
European ancestry is very rare among children with T1D. Among 4490 children with 
T1D in the Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Register 57 (1.3%) cases with DQB1*06:02 
were identified in comparison to 26.1% of affected family-based association 
controls. There was no difference between DQB1*06:02 positive and negative 
children with T1D regarding sex, age, islet autoantibody distribution or 
autoantibody levels, but significant differences were seen in the frequency of 
the second class II HLA haplotypes. The most prevalent haplotype present with 
DQB1*06:02 was DRB1*04:04-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02 which was found in 27 of 57 (47.4%) 
children compared to only 797/4433 (18.0%) among DQB1*06:02 negative cases 
(P<0.001, Chi-square test). The other common risk associated haplotypes, the 
DRB1*04:01-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02 and (DR3)-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 were less prevalent in 
DQB1*06:02 positive than DQB1*06:02 negative children (P<0.001). HLA-B allele 
frequencies did not differ between DQB1*06:02 haplotypes in children with T1D 
and controls and neither in DRB1*04:04-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02 haplotypes of 
DQB1*06:02 positive and negative T1D children. The increased frequency of 
DRB1*04:04 allele among DQB1*06:02 positive cases may indicate preferential 
ability of the DR404 molecule to present islet antigen epitopes despite of the 
competition by DQ602.

Kidney transplantation is the preferred therapeutic option for end-stage renal 
disease; however, the alloimmune response is still the leading cause of renal 
allograft failure. To better identify immunologic disparities in order to 
evaluate HLA compatibility between the donor and the recipient, the concept of 
eplet load has arisen. Regular kidney function monitoring is essential for the 
accurate and timely diagnosis of allograft rejection and the appropriate 
treatment. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has been proposed as a 
potential biomarker of acute rejection and graft failure in kidney 
transplantation. The proportion of plasma dd-cfDNA was determined in forty-two 
kidney patients at 1 month after transplantation. A total of eleven (26.2%) 
patients had a dd-cfDNA proportion of ≥1.0%. The only pretransplant variable 
related to dd-cfDNA > 1.0% was the HLA class II eplet mismatch load, mainly the 
HLA-DQB1 eplet mismatch load. Furthermore, dd-cfDNA was able to discriminate the 
patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) (AUC 87.3%), acute rejection 
(AUC 78.2%), and troubled graft (AUC 81.4%). Increased dd-cfDNA levels were 
associated with kidney allograft deterioration, particularly rejection, as well 
as a greater HLA class II eplet mismatch load. Consequently, combining dd-cfDNA 
determination and HLA eplet mismatch load calculation should improve the 
assessment of the risk of short- and long-term allograft damage.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable, debilitating 
neurodegenerative disorder. Current biomarkers for AD diagnosis require 
expensive neuroimaging or invasive cerebrospinal fluid sampling, thus precluding 
early detection. Blood-based biomarker discovery in Alzheimer's can facilitate 
less-invasive, routine diagnostic tests to aid early intervention. Therefore, we 
propose "c-Diadem" (constrained dual-input Alzheimer's disease model), a novel 
deep learning classifier which incorporates KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes) pathway constraints on the input genotyping data to predict 
disease, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD or cognitively normal (CN). 
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to explain the model and identify 
novel, potential blood-based genetic markers of MCI/AD.
METHODS: We developed a novel constrained deep learning neural network which 
utilizes SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and microarray data from ADNI 
(Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) to predict the disease status of 
participants, i.e., CN or with disease (MCI/AD), and identify potential 
blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis and intervention. The dataset contains 
samples from 626 participants, of which 212 are CN (average age 
74.6 ± 5.4 years) and 414 patients have MCI/AD (average age 72.7 ± 7.6 years). 
KEGG pathway information was used to generate constraints applied to the input 
tensors, thus enhancing the interpretability of the model. SHAP scores were used 
to identify genes which could potentially serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and 
targets for drug development.
RESULTS: Our model's performance, with accuracy of 69% and AUC of 70% in the 
test dataset, is superior to previous models. The SHAP scores show that SNPs in 
PRKCZ, PLCB1 and ITPR2 as well as expression of HLA-DQB1, EIF1AY, HLA-DQA1, and 
ZFP57 have more impact on model predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to predicting MCI/AD, our model has been interrogated 
for potential genetic biomarkers using SHAP. From our analysis, we have 
identified blood-based genetic markers related to Ca2+ ion release in affected 
regions of the brain, as well as depression. The findings from our study 
provides insights into disease mechanisms, and can facilitate innovation in 
less-invasive, cost-effective diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, our 
model is the first to use pathway constraints in a multimodal neural network to 
identify potential genetic markers for AD.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant chemical modifications on 
RNA and can affect the occurrence and development of diseases. Some studies have 
shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated 
by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified 
the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship 
between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and 
gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 
m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed 
(P < 0.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P < 1e-04) were 
differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the 
expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals 
(HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the 
three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding 
the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as 
therapeutic target.

Introduction: Beta-lactam antibiotics are one of the most common causes of 
antibiotics-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reactions 
with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized 
exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Recent evidence demonstrated that the human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms play important roles in the development of 
drug-related SCARs. This study aimed to extensively characterize the 
associations between HLA genetic polymorphisms and several phenotypes of SCARs 
related to beta-lactam antibiotics. Methods: Thirty-one Thai patients with 
beta-lactam antibiotics-related SCARs were enrolled in the study. A total of 183 
unrelated native Thai subjects without any evidence of drug allergy were 
recruited as the control group. Genotyping of HLA class I and class II alleles 
was performed. Results: Six HLA alleles including HLA-A*01:01, HLA-B*50:01, 
HLA-C*06:02, HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DQA1*03:01, and HLA-DQB1*03:02, were 
significantly associated with beta-lactam antibiotics-related SCARs. The highest 
risk of SCARs was observed in patients with the HLA-B*50:01 allele (OR = 12.6, 
95% CI = 1.1-142.9, p = 0.042), followed by the HLA-DQB1*03:02 allele (OR = 5.8, 
95% CI = 1.5-22.0, p = 0.012) and the HLA-C*06:02 allele (OR = 5.7, 95% CI = 
1.6-19.9, p = 0.011). According to the phenotypes of SCARs related to 
beta-lactam antibiotics, the higher risk of SJS/TEN was observed in patients 
with HLA-A*03:02, HLA-B*46:02 (OR = 17.5, 95% CI = 1.5-201.6, p = 0.033), 
HLA-A*02:06, HLA-B*57:01 (OR = 9.5, 95% CI = 1.3-71.5, p = 0.028), 
HLA-DQB1*03:02 (OR = 7.5, 95% CI = 1.8-30.9, p = 0.008), or HLA-C*06:02 (OR = 
4.9, 95% CI = 1.1-21.4, p = 0.008). While eight HLA alleles including 
HLA-A*02:05, HLA-A*02:11, HLA-B*37:01, HLA-B*38:01, HLA-B*50:01, HLA-C*06:02, 
HLA-C*03:09, and HLA-DRB1*15:01 were associated with AGEP, the highest risk of 
AGEP was observed in patients with the HLA-B*50:01 allele (OR = 60.7, 95% CI = 
4.8-765.00, p = 0.005). Among the four HLA alleles associated with DRESS 
including HLA-C*04:06, HLA-DRB1*04:05, HLA-DRB1*11:01, and HLA-DQB1*04:01, the 
HLA-C*04:06 allele had the highest risk of beta-lactam antibiotics-related DRESS 
(OR = 60.0, 95% CI = 3.0-1202.1, p = 0.043). However, these associations did not 
achieve statistical significance after Bonferroni's correction. Apart from the 
HLA risk alleles, the HLA-A*02:07 allele appeared to be a protective factor 
against beta-lactam antibiotic-related SCARs (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.0-0.5, p = 
3.7 × 10-4, Pc = 0.012). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the candidate HLA 
alleles that are significantly associated with several phenotypes of beta-lactam 
antibiotics-related SCARs. However, whether the HLA alleles observed in this 
study can be used as valid genetic markers for SCARs related to beta-lactam 
antibiotics needs to be further explored in other ethnicities and larger cohort 
studies.

PURPOSE: Alopecia areata (AA) is one of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases 
affecting humans. Given that hair follicles are immune-privileged, autoimmunity 
can result in disfiguring hair loss. However, the genetic basis for AA in the 
Taiwanese population remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A genome-wide association study was conducted using a 
cohort of 408 AA cases and 8167 controls. To link variants to gene 
relationships, we used 882 SNPs (P<1E-05) within 74 genes that were associated 
with AA group to build the biological networks by IPA software. HLA diplotypes 
and haplotypes were analyzed using Attribute Bagging (HIBAG)-R package and 
chi-square analysis.
RESULTS: Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including LINC02006 
(rs531166736, rs187306735), APC (rs112800832_C_CAT), SRP19 (rs139948960, 
rs144784670), EGFLAM (rs16903975) and LDLRAD3 (rs79874564) were closely 
associated with the AA phenotype (P<5E-08). Examination of biological networks 
revealed that these genomic areas are associated with antigen presentation 
signaling, B cell and T cell development, Th1 and Th2 activation pathways, Notch 
signaling, crosstalk signaling between dendritic cells and natural killer cells, 
and phagosome maturation. Based on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype 
analysis, four HLA genotypes (HLA-B*15:01-*40:01, HLA-DQA1*01:02-*03:03, 
HLA-DQA1*01:02, and HLA-DQB1*02:01) were found to be associated with AA 
(adjusted p-value<0.05). HLA-DQA1*01:02 is the most significantly related gene 
in the Taiwanese population (adjusted p-value = 2.09E-05).
CONCLUSION: This study successfully identified susceptibility loci associated 
with AA in the Taiwanese population. These findings not only shed light on the 
origins of AA within the Taiwanese context but also contribute to a 
comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors influencing AA 
susceptibility.
