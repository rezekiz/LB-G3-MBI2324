Food allergy is an increasingly important health problem in the world. Several 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on European ancestry samples have 
identified food allergy-specific loci in the HLA class II region. We conducted 
GWAS of self-reported reactivity with common foods using the data from 11011 
Japanese women and identified shrimp and peach allergy-specific loci in the 
HLA-DR/DQ gene region tagged by rs74995702 (P = 6.30 × 10-17, OR = 1.91) and 
rs28359884 (P = 2.3 × 10-12, OR = 1.80), respectively. After HLA imputation 
using a Japanese population-specific reference, the most strongly associated 
haplotype was HLA-DRB1*04:05-HLA-DQB1*04:01 for shrimp allergy 
(P = 3.92 × 10-19, OR = 1.99) and HLA-DRB1*09:01-HLA-DQB1*03:03 for peach 
allergy (P = 1.15 × 10-7, OR = 1.68). Additionally, both allergies' associated 
variants were eQTLs for several HLA genes, with HLA-DQA2 the single eQTL gene 
shared between the two traits. Our study suggests that allergy to certain foods 
may be related to genetic differences that tag both HLA alleles having 
particular epitope binding specificities as well as variants modulating 
expression of particular HLA genes. Investigating this further could increase 
our understanding of food allergy aetiology and potentially lead to better 
therapeutic strategies for allergen immunotherapies.
