BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a kind of cholestatic liver 
disease without effective therapies and its pathogenesis is largely unknown.
METHODS: We performed the proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) design to 
estimate the causal associations of protein levels with PSC risk. Therein, 
genetic associations with 4,907 plasma protein levels were extracted from a 
proteome-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 35,559 individuals and 
those with PSC were obtained from the International PSC Study Group (2,871 cases 
and 12,019 controls) and the FinnGen study (1,491 cases and 301,383 controls). 
The colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by 
proteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and 
diseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs 
were assessed as well.
RESULTS: The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 
proteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins 
were inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all 
survived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 
(allograft inflammatory factor 1) and HLA-DQA2 (major histocompatibility 
complex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be 
direct targets for PSC. The phenome-wide screening suggested that variants 
located at AIF1 or HLA-DQA2 region were closely associated with several 
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, implicating the shared 
pathogenesis among them.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highly pinpointed two candidate targets (AIF1 and 
HLA-DQA2) for PSC.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant chemical modifications on 
RNA and can affect the occurrence and development of diseases. Some studies have 
shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated 
by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified 
the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship 
between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and 
gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 
m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed 
(P < 0.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P < 1e-04) were 
differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the 
expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals 
(HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the 
three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding 
the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as 
therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Plasma proteins are potential biomarkers for complex diseases. We 
aimed to identify plasma protein biomarkers for lung cancer.
METHODS: We investigated genetically predicted plasma levels of 1130 proteins in 
association with lung cancer risk among 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls of 
European descent. For proteins significantly associated with lung cancer risk, 
we evaluated associations of genetically predicted expression of their coding 
genes with the risk of lung cancer.
RESULTS: Nine proteins were identified with genetically predicted plasma levels 
significantly associated with overall lung cancer risk at a false discovery rate 
(FDR) of <0.05. Proteins C2, MICA, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with increased 
lung cancer risk, while proteins SFTPB, HLA-DQA2, MICB, NRP1, and GMFG were 
associated with decreased lung cancer risk. Stratified analyses by histological 
types revealed the cross-subtype consistency of these nine associations and 
identified an additional protein, ICAM5, significantly associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma risk (FDR < 0.05). Coding genes of NRP1 and ICAM5 proteins are 
located at two loci that have never been reported by previous GWAS. Genetically 
predicted blood levels of genes C2, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with lung 
cancer risk, in directions consistent with those shown in protein-level 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Identification of novel plasma protein biomarkers provided new 
insights into the biology of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the deadliest and most diagnosed type of cancer 
worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dropped 
significantly when tumor stages advanced. Patients who received surgically 
resecting at the pre-invasive stage had a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. 
However, the study on the differences in gene expression profiles and immune 
microenvironment among pre-invasive LUAD patients is still lacking.
METHODS: In this study, the gene expression profiles of three pre-invasive LUAD 
stages were compared using the RNA-sequencing data of 10 adenocarcinoma in situ 
(AIS) samples, 12 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) samples, and 10 
invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) samples.
RESULTS: The high expression levels of PTGFRN (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95% 
Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.08-1.94; log-rank P = 0.013) and SPP1 (HR = 1.44; 
95% CI: 1.07-1.93; log-rank P = 0.015) were identified to be associated with 
LUAD prognosis. Moreover, the early LUAD invasion was accompanied by the 
enhancement of antigen presentation ability, reflected by the increase of 
myeloid dendritic cells infiltration rate (Cuzick test P < 0.01) and the 
upregulation of seven important genes participating in the antigen presentation, 
including HLA-A (Cuzick test P = 0.03), MICA (Cuzick test P = 0.01), MICB 
(Cuzick test P = 0.01), HLA-DPA1 (Cuzick test P = 0.04), HLA-DQA2 (Cuzick test P 
< 0.01), HLA-DQB1 (Cuzick test P = 0.03), and HLA-DQB2 (Cuzick test P < 0.01). 
However, the tumor-killing ability of the immune system was inhibited during 
this process, as there were no rising cytotoxic T cell activity (Cuzick test P = 
0.20) and no increasing expression in genes encoding cytotoxic proteins.
CONCLUSION: In all, our research elucidated the changes in the immune 
microenvironment during early-stage LUAD evolution and may provide a theoretical 
basis for developing novel early-stage lung cancer therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 
and despite recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the 
clinical benefit remains limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further 
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the expression and function of NPM3 in the tumor 
microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
METHODS: We utilized bioinformatics tools and databases, including UALCAN, 
GEPIA2, HPA, and Sangerbox, to analyze NPM3 expression in LUAD samples and its 
association with prognosis and mutational landscape. NPM3 expression in various 
cell types was assessed at the single cell level using the TISCH database. We 
also used algorithms such as TIMER and EPIC to explore the crosstalk between 
NPM3 expression and immune features. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to 
identify potential signaling pathways of NPM3. Finally, we employed siRNA 
knockdown strategy to investigate the effect of NPM3 on LUAD cell proliferation 
and migration in vitro.
RESULTS: NPM3 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues and was strongly 
associated with poor prognosis and TP53 gene mutations. Single-cell sequencing 
analysis revealed that NPM3 was expressed in immune cells (dendritic cells and 
monocytes/macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, NPM3 expression 
was negatively associated with immune B cell and CD4 T cell infiltration, as 
well as with several immune-related genes (including CCL22, CXCR2, CX3CR1, CCR6, 
HLA-DOA, HLA-DQA2). KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that NPM3 expression was 
associated with cell cycle, CAMs, and NSCLC pathway genes. Finally, in vitro 
experiments showed that NPM3 knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and 
migration in NCI-H1299 and SPC-A1 cells, and suppressed the expression of CCNA2 
and MAD2L1.
CONCLUSION: Elevated NPM3 expression predicts poor clinical outcome and an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment in LUAD tissues. NPM3 promotes LUAD 
progression by promoting cell proliferation and migration, and targeting NPM3 
may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for LUAD.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and genetically characterize subgroups of patients with 
ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) based on sex and ANCA subtype.
METHODS: A previously established SNP dataset derived from DNA sequencing of 
1853 genes and genotyping of 1088 Scandinavian cases with AAV and 1589 controls 
was stratified for sex and ANCA subtype and analysed for association with five 
top AAV SNPs. rs9274619, a lead variant at the HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 locus 
previously associated with AAV positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA, was 
analysed for association with the cumulative disease involvement of ten 
different organ systems.
RESULTS: rs9274619 showed a significantly stronger association to 
MPO-ANCA-positive females than males [P = 2.0 × 10-4, OR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.5, 
3.5)], whereas proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA-associated variants rs1042335, rs9277341 
(HLA-DPB1/A1) and rs28929474 (SERPINA1) were equally associated with females and 
males with PR3-ANCA. In MPO-ANCA-positive cases, carriers of the rs9274619 risk 
allele were more prone to disease engagement of eyes [P = 0.021, OR = 11 (95% CI 
2.2, 205)] but less prone to pulmonary involvement [P = 0.026, OR = 0.52 (95% CI 
0.30, 0.92)]. Moreover, AAV with both MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA was associated with 
the PR3-ANCA lead SNP rs1042335 [P = 0.0015, OR = 0.091 (95% CI 0.0022, 0.55)] 
but not with rs9274619.
CONCLUSIONS: Females and males with MPO-ANCA-positive AAV differ in genetic 
predisposition to disease, suggesting at least partially distinct disease 
mechanisms between the sexes. Double ANCA-positive AAV cases are genetically 
similar to PR3-ANCA-positive cases, providing clues to the clinical follow-up 
and treatment of these patients.

BACKGROUND: RNA modification plays important roles in many biological processes, 
such as gene expression control. The aim of this study was to identify single 
nucleotide polymorphisms related to RNA modification (RNAm-SNPs) for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) as putative functional variants.
METHODS: We examined the association of RNAm-SNPs with RA in summary data from a 
genome-wide association study of 19,234 RA cases and 61,565 controls. We 
performed eQTL and pQTL analyses for the RNAm-SNPs to find associated gene 
expression and protein levels. Furthermore, we examined the associations of gene 
expression and circulating protein levels with RA using two-sample Mendelian 
randomization analysis methods.
RESULTS: A total of 160 RNAm-SNPs related to m6A, m1A, A-to-I, m7G, m5C, m5U and 
m6Am modifications were identified to be significantly associated with RA. These 
RNAm-SNPs were located in 62 protein-coding genes, which were significantly 
enriched in immune-related pathways. RNAm-SNPs in important RA susceptibility 
genes, such as PADI2, SPRED2, PLCL2, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, TRAF1 and 
TXNDC11, were identified. Most of these RNAm-SNPs showed eQTL effects, and the 
expression levels of 26 of the modifiable genes (e.g., PADI2, TRAF1, HLA-A, 
HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-B) in blood cells were associated with RA. 
Circulating protein levels, such as CFB, GZMA, HLA-DQA2, IL21, LRPAP1 and TFF3, 
were affected by RNAm-SNPs and were associated with RA.
CONCLUSION: The present study identified RNAm-SNPs in the reported RA 
susceptibility genes and suggested that RNAm-SNPs may affect RA risk by 
affecting the expression levels of corresponding genes and proteins.

As an effective supplement to the current forensic DNA typing and one of the 
research hotpots in forensic science, the in-depth mining and characterization 
of biological evidence can provide rich and reliable clues for case 
investigation. In this study, the time-dependent variations of transcriptome 
were confirmed in in vitro blood samples within 0-168 days and a random forest 
model was established to realize the classification of blood samples with 
different TSD (time since deposition). Meanwhile, significant differences were 
observed in the transcripts of blood samples with different smoking habits and 
genders within a certain time period. HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 were 
identified as markers for smoking habit identification, while the transcripts 
for RPS4Y1 and EIF1AY from the non-recombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY) 
were identified as markers for male sex identification. Thus, this study 
provides a theoretical foundation and experimental strategy for establishing a 
transcriptome-based method for characterizing blood sample retention time and 
donor characteristics in the field of forensic investigation.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease with a 
heterogenous clinical presentation and unpredictable response to available 
therapies. This personalized transcriptomics study sought proof-of-concept for 
single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize patient-specific immune profiles.
METHODS: Whole blood samples from six untreated children, newly diagnosed with 
JIA, and two healthy controls were cultured for 24 h with or without ex vivo TNF 
stimulation and subjected to scRNAseq to examine cellular populations and 
transcript expression in PBMCs. A novel analytical pipeline, scPool, was 
developed wherein cells are first pooled into pseudocells prior to expression 
analysis, facilitating variance partitioning of the effects of TNF stimulus, JIA 
disease status, and individual donor.
RESULTS: Seventeen robust immune cell-types were identified, the abundance of 
which was significantly affected by TNF stimulus, which resulted in notable 
elevation of memory CD8 + T-cells and NK56 cells, but down-regulation of naïve 
B-cell proportions. Memory CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells were also both reduced in the 
JIA cases relative to two controls. Significant differential expression 
responses to TNF stimulus were also characterized, with monocytes showing more 
transcriptional shifts than T-lymphocyte subsets, while the B-cell response was 
more limited. We also show that donor variability exceeds the small degree of 
possible intrinsic differentiation between JIA and control profiles. An 
incidental finding of interest was association of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRB5 
expression with JIA status.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of personalized 
immune-profiling combined with ex-vivo immune stimulation for evaluation of 
patient-specific modes of immune cell activity in autoimmune rheumatic disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to identify molecular mechanisms in brain 
tissue of Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) when compared to people with non-RE 
epilepsy (PWE) and control cases using whole exome sequencing (WES), RNAseq, and 
proteomics.
METHODS: Frozen brain tissue (ages = 2-19 years) was obtained from control 
autopsy (n = 14), surgical PWE (n = 10), and surgical RE cases (n = 27). We 
evaluated WES variants in RE associated with epilepsy, seizures, RE, and human 
leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Differential expression was evaluated by RNAseq 
(adjusted p < .05) and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (false 
discovery rate < 5%) in the three groups.
RESULTS: WES revealed no common pathogenic variants in RE, but several rare and 
likely deleterious variants of unknown significance (VUS; ANGPTL7/MTOR, SCN1A, 
FCGR3B, MTOR) and more common HLA VUS in >25% of RE cases (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2), 
all with allele frequency < 5% in the general population. RNAseq in RE versus 
PWE (1516 altered transcripts) revealed significant activation of crosstalk 
between dendritic and natural killer cells (p = 7.94 × 10-6 , z = 2.65), in RE 
versus control (7466 transcripts) neuroinflammation signaling activation 
(p = 6.31 × 10-13 , z = 5.07), and in PWE versus control (945 transcripts) 
phagosome formation activation (p = 2.00 × 10-13 , z = 5.61). Proteomics 
detected fewer altered targets.
SIGNIFICANCE: In RE, we identified activated immune signaling pathways and 
immune cell type annotation enrichment that suggest roles of the innate and 
adaptive immune responses, as well as HLA variants that may increase 
vulnerability to RE. Follow-up studies could evaluate cell type density and 
subregional localization associated with top targets, clinical history 
(neuropathology, disease duration), and whether modulating crosstalk between 
dendritic and natural killer cells may limit disease progression.
