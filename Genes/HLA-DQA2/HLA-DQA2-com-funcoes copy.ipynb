      "disease without effective therapies and its pathogenesis is largely unknown.\n",

      "estimate the causal associations of protein levels with PSC risk. Therein, \n",
      "genetic associations with 4,907 plasma protein levels were extracted from a \n",
      "proteome-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 35,559 individuals and \n",
      "those with PSC were obtained from the International PSC Study Group (2,871 cases \n",
      "and 12,019 controls) and the FinnGen study (1,491 cases and 301,383 controls). \n",
      "The colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by \n",
      "proteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and \n",
      "diseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs \n",
      "were assessed as well.\n",
      "RESULTS: The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 \n",
      "proteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins \n",
      "were inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all \n",
      "survived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 \n",

      "complex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be \n",

Therein, \\ngenetic associations with 4,907 plasma protein levels were extracted from a \\nproteome-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 35,559 individuals and \\nthose with PSC were obtained from the International PSC Study Group (2,871 cases \\nand 12,019 controls) and the FinnGen study (1,491 cases and 301,383 controls). \\nThe colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by \\nproteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and \\ndiseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs \\nwere assessed as well.\\nRESULTS: The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 \\nproteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins \\nwere inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all \\nsurvived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 \\n(allograft inflammatory factor 1) and HLA-DQA2 (major histocompatibility \\ncomplex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be \\ndirect targets for PSC. The phenome-wide screening suggested that variants \\nlocated at AIF1 or HLA-DQA2 region were closely associated with several \\nautoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, implicating the shared \\npathogenesis among them.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study highly pinpointed two candidate targets (AIF1 and \\nHLA-DQA2) for PSC.\\n\\n© 2023.

Some studies have \\nshown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated \\nby single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated \\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis \\n(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified \\nthe disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study \\n(GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship \\nbetween these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and \\ngene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 \\nm6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed \\n(P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P\\xa0<\\xa01e-04) were \\ndifferentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the \\nexpression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals \\n(HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the \\nthree diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding \\nthe potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as \\ntherapeutic target.\\n\\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The 5-year survival rate of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dropped \\nsignificantly when tumor stages advanced. Patients who received surgically \\nresecting at the pre-invasive stage had a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. \\nHowever, the study on the differences in gene expression profiles and immune \\nmicroenvironment among pre-invasive LUAD patients is still lacking.\\nMETHODS: In this study, the gene expression profiles of three pre-invasive LUAD \\nstages were compared using the RNA-sequencing data of 10 adenocarcinoma in situ \\n(AIS) samples, 12 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) samples, and 10 \\ninvasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) samples.\\nRESULTS: The high expression levels of PTGFRN (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95% \\nConfidence Interval [CI]: 1.08-1.94; log-rank P = 0.013) and SPP1 (HR = 1.44; \\n95% CI: 1.07-1.93; log-rank P = 0.015) were identified to be associated with \\nLUAD prognosis. Moreover, the early LUAD invasion was accompanied by the \\nenhancement of antigen presentation ability, reflected by the increase of \\nmyeloid dendritic cells infiltration rate (Cuzick test P < 0.01) and the \\nupregulation of seven important genes participating in the antigen presentation, \\nincluding HLA-A (Cuzick test P = 0.03), MICA (Cuzick test P = 0.01), MICB \\n(Cuzick test P = 0.01), HLA-DPA1 (Cuzick test P = 0.04), HLA-DQA2 (Cuzick test P \\n< 0.01), HLA-DQB1 (Cuzick test P = 0.03), and HLA-DQB2 (Cuzick test P < 0.01). \\nHowever, the tumor-killing ability of the immune system was inhibited during \\nthis process, as there were no rising cytotoxic T cell activity (Cuzick test P = \\n0.20) and no increasing expression in genes encoding cytotoxic proteins.\\nCONCLUSION: In all, our research elucidated the changes in the immune \\nmicroenvironment during early-stage LUAD evolution and may provide a theoretical \\nbasis for developing novel early-stage lung cancer therapeutic targets.\\n\\nCopyright © 2023 Liu, Ji, Weng, Shao, Zhao, Chen, Shen, Wang, Meng, Wu, Wang, Ou \\nand Ke.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1150098\\nPMCID: PMC10328385\\nPMID: 37427097\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: HC, LS, FW, QM, XWU, XWA, and QO are employees \\nof Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc., China.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to further \\ninvestigate the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer. The aim of this \\nstudy was to investigate the expression and function of NPM3 in the tumor \\nmicroenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).\\nMETHODS: We utilized bioinformatics tools and databases, including UALCAN, \\nGEPIA2, HPA, and Sangerbox, to analyze NPM3 expression in LUAD samples and its \\nassociation with prognosis and mutational landscape. NPM3 expression in various \\ncell types was assessed at the single cell level using the TISCH database. We \\nalso used algorithms such as TIMER and EPIC to explore the crosstalk between \\nNPM3 expression and immune features. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to \\nidentify potential signaling pathways of NPM3. Finally, we employed siRNA \\nknockdown strategy to investigate the effect of NPM3 on LUAD cell proliferation \\nand migration in vitro.\\nRESULTS: NPM3 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues and was strongly \\nassociated with poor prognosis and TP53 gene mutations. Single-cell sequencing \\nanalysis revealed that NPM3 was expressed in immune cells (dendritic cells and \\nmonocytes/macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, NPM3 expression \\nwas negatively associated with immune B cell and CD4 T cell infiltration, as \\nwell as with several immune-related genes (including CCL22, CXCR2, CX3CR1, CCR6, \\nHLA-DOA, HLA-DQA2). KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that NPM3 expression was \\nassociated with cell cycle, CAMs, and NSCLC pathway genes. Finally, in vitro \\nexperiments showed that NPM3 knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and \\nmigration in NCI-H1299 and SPC-A1 cells, and suppressed the expression of CCNA2 \\nand MAD2L1.\\nCONCLUSION: Elevated NPM3 expression predicts poor clinical outcome and an \\nimmunosuppressive microenvironment in LUAD tissues.

The aim of this study was to identify single \\nnucleotide polymorphisms related to RNA modification (RNAm-SNPs) for rheumatoid \\narthritis (RA) as putative functional variants.\\nMETHODS: We examined the association of RNAm-SNPs with RA in summary data from a \\ngenome-wide association study of 19,234 RA cases and 61,565 controls. We \\nperformed eQTL and pQTL analyses for the RNAm-SNPs to find associated gene \\nexpression and protein levels. Furthermore, we examined the associations of gene \\nexpression and circulating protein levels with RA using two-sample Mendelian \\nrandomization analysis methods.\\nRESULTS: A total of 160 RNAm-SNPs related to m6A, m1A, A-to-I, m7G, m5C, m5U and \\nm6Am modifications were identified to be significantly associated with RA. These \\nRNAm-SNPs were located in 62 protein-coding genes, which were significantly \\nenriched in immune-related pathways. RNAm-SNPs in important RA susceptibility \\ngenes, such as PADI2, SPRED2, PLCL2, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, TRAF1 and \\nTXNDC11, were identified. Most of these RNAm-SNPs showed eQTL effects, and the \\nexpression levels of 26 of the modifiable genes (e.g., PADI2, TRAF1, HLA-A, \\nHLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-B) in blood cells were associated with RA. \\nCirculating protein levels, such as CFB, GZMA, HLA-DQA2, IL21, LRPAP1 and TFF3, \\nwere affected by RNAm-SNPs and were associated with RA.\\nCONCLUSION: The present study identified RNAm-SNPs in the reported RA \\nsusceptibility genes and suggested that RNAm-SNPs may affect RA risk by \\naffecting the expression levels of corresponding genes and proteins.\\n\\n© 2023.

This personalized transcriptomics study sought proof-of-concept for \\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing to characterize patient-specific immune profiles.\\nMETHODS: Whole blood samples from six untreated children, newly diagnosed with \\nJIA, and two healthy controls were cultured for 24\\xa0h with or without ex vivo TNF \\nstimulation and subjected to scRNAseq to examine cellular populations and \\ntranscript expression in PBMCs. A novel analytical pipeline, scPool, was \\ndeveloped wherein cells are first pooled into pseudocells prior to expression \\nanalysis, facilitating variance partitioning of the effects of TNF stimulus, JIA \\ndisease status, and individual donor.\\nRESULTS: Seventeen robust immune cell-types were identified, the abundance of \\nwhich was significantly affected by TNF stimulus, which resulted in notable \\nelevation of memory CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T-cells and NK56 cells, but down-regulation of naïve \\nB-cell proportions. Memory CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T-cells were also both reduced in the \\nJIA cases relative to two controls. Significant differential expression \\nresponses to TNF stimulus were also characterized, with monocytes showing more \\ntranscriptional shifts than T-lymphocyte subsets, while the B-cell response was \\nmore limited. We also show that donor variability exceeds the small degree of \\npossible intrinsic differentiation between JIA and control profiles. An \\nincidental finding of interest was association of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRB5 \\nexpression with JIA status.\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of personalized \\nimmune-profiling combined with ex-vivo immune stimulation for evaluation of \\npatient-specific modes of immune cell activity in autoimmune rheumatic disease.\\n\\n© 2023.

We \\nevaluated WES variants in RE associated with epilepsy, seizures, RE, and human \\nleukocyte antigens (HLAs). Differential expression was evaluated by RNAseq \\n(adjusted p\\u2009<\\u2009.05) and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (false \\ndiscovery rate\\u2009<\\u20095%) in the three groups.\\nRESULTS: WES revealed no common pathogenic variants in RE, but several rare and \\nlikely deleterious variants of unknown significance (VUS; ANGPTL7/MTOR, SCN1A, \\nFCGR3B, MTOR) and more common HLA VUS in >25% of RE cases (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2), \\nall with allele frequency\\u2009<\\u20095% in the general population. RNAseq in RE versus \\nPWE (1516 altered transcripts) revealed significant activation of crosstalk \\nbetween dendritic and natural killer cells (p\\xa0=\\xa07.94\\u2009×\\u200910-6 , z\\xa0=\\xa02.65), in RE \\nversus control (7466 transcripts) neuroinflammation signaling activation \\n(p\\xa0=\\xa06.31\\u2009×\\u200910-13 , z\\xa0=\\xa05.07), and in PWE versus control (945 transcripts) \\nphagosome formation activation (p\\xa0=\\xa02.00\\u2009×\\u200910-13 , z\\xa0=\\xa05.61). Proteomics \\ndetected fewer altered targets.\\nSIGNIFICANCE: In RE, we identified activated immune signaling pathways and \\nimmune cell type annotation enrichment that suggest roles of the innate and \\nadaptive immune responses, as well as HLA variants that may increase \\nvulnerability to RE. Follow-up studies could evaluate cell type density and \\nsubregional localization associated with top targets, clinical history \\n(neuropathology, disease duration), and whether modulating crosstalk between \\ndendritic and natural killer cells may limit disease progression.\\n\\n© 2022 International League Against Epilepsy.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1111/epi.17457\\nPMCID: PMC9852002\\nPMID: 36336987 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\""
