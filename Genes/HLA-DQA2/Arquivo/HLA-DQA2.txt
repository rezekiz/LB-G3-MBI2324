BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a kind of cholestatic liver 
disease without effective therapies and its pathogenesis is largely unknown.
METHODS: We performed the proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) design to 
estimate the causal associations of protein levels with PSC risk. Therein, 
genetic associations with 4,907 plasma protein levels were extracted from a 
proteome-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 35,559 individuals and 
those with PSC were obtained from the International PSC Study Group (2,871 cases 
and 12,019 controls) and the FinnGen study (1,491 cases and 301,383 controls). 
The colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by 
proteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and 
diseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs 
were assessed as well.
RESULTS: The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 
proteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins 
were inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all 
survived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 
(allograft inflammatory factor 1) and HLA-DQA2 (major histocompatibility 
complex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be 
direct targets for PSC. The phenome-wide screening suggested that variants 
located at AIF1 or HLA-DQA2 region were closely associated with several 
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, implicating the shared 
pathogenesis among them.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highly pinpointed two candidate targets (AIF1 and 
HLA-DQA2) for PSC.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant chemical modifications on 
RNA and can affect the occurrence and development of diseases. Some studies have 
shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated 
by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified 
the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship 
between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and 
gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 
m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed 
(P < 0.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P < 1e-04) were 
differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the 
expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals 
(HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the 
three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding 
the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as 
therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Plasma proteins are potential biomarkers for complex diseases. We 
aimed to identify plasma protein biomarkers for lung cancer.
METHODS: We investigated genetically predicted plasma levels of 1130 proteins in 
association with lung cancer risk among 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls of 
European descent. For proteins significantly associated with lung cancer risk, 
we evaluated associations of genetically predicted expression of their coding 
genes with the risk of lung cancer.
RESULTS: Nine proteins were identified with genetically predicted plasma levels 
significantly associated with overall lung cancer risk at a false discovery rate 
(FDR) of <0.05. Proteins C2, MICA, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with increased 
lung cancer risk, while proteins SFTPB, HLA-DQA2, MICB, NRP1, and GMFG were 
associated with decreased lung cancer risk. Stratified analyses by histological 
types revealed the cross-subtype consistency of these nine associations and 
identified an additional protein, ICAM5, significantly associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma risk (FDR < 0.05). Coding genes of NRP1 and ICAM5 proteins are 
located at two loci that have never been reported by previous GWAS. Genetically 
predicted blood levels of genes C2, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with lung 
cancer risk, in directions consistent with those shown in protein-level 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Identification of novel plasma protein biomarkers provided new 
insights into the biology of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the deadliest and most diagnosed type of cancer 
worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dropped 
significantly when tumor stages advanced. Patients who received surgically 
resecting at the pre-invasive stage had a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. 
However, the study on the differences in gene expression profiles and immune 
microenvironment among pre-invasive LUAD patients is still lacking.
METHODS: In this study, the gene expression profiles of three pre-invasive LUAD 
stages were compared using the RNA-sequencing data of 10 adenocarcinoma in situ 
(AIS) samples, 12 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) samples, and 10 
invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) samples.
RESULTS: The high expression levels of PTGFRN (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95% 
Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.08-1.94; log-rank P = 0.013) and SPP1 (HR = 1.44; 
95% CI: 1.07-1.93; log-rank P = 0.015) were identified to be associated with 
LUAD prognosis. Moreover, the early LUAD invasion was accompanied by the 
enhancement of antigen presentation ability, reflected by the increase of 
myeloid dendritic cells infiltration rate (Cuzick test P < 0.01) and the 
upregulation of seven important genes participating in the antigen presentation, 
including HLA-A (Cuzick test P = 0.03), MICA (Cuzick test P = 0.01), MICB 
(Cuzick test P = 0.01), HLA-DPA1 (Cuzick test P = 0.04), HLA-DQA2 (Cuzick test P 
< 0.01), HLA-DQB1 (Cuzick test P = 0.03), and HLA-DQB2 (Cuzick test P < 0.01). 
However, the tumor-killing ability of the immune system was inhibited during 
this process, as there were no rising cytotoxic T cell activity (Cuzick test P = 
0.20) and no increasing expression in genes encoding cytotoxic proteins.
CONCLUSION: In all, our research elucidated the changes in the immune 
microenvironment during early-stage LUAD evolution and may provide a theoretical 
basis for developing novel early-stage lung cancer therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 
and despite recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the 
clinical benefit remains limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further 
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the expression and function of NPM3 in the tumor 
microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
METHODS: We utilized bioinformatics tools and databases, including UALCAN, 
GEPIA2, HPA, and Sangerbox, to analyze NPM3 expression in LUAD samples and its 
association with prognosis and mutational landscape. NPM3 expression in various 
cell types was assessed at the single cell level using the TISCH database. We 
also used algorithms such as TIMER and EPIC to explore the crosstalk between 
NPM3 expression and immune features. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to 
identify potential signaling pathways of NPM3. Finally, we employed siRNA 
knockdown strategy to investigate the effect of NPM3 on LUAD cell proliferation 
and migration in vitro.
RESULTS: NPM3 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues and was strongly 
associated with poor prognosis and TP53 gene mutations. Single-cell sequencing 
analysis revealed that NPM3 was expressed in immune cells (dendritic cells and 
monocytes/macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, NPM3 expression 
was negatively associated with immune B cell and CD4 T cell infiltration, as 
well as with several immune-related genes (including CCL22, CXCR2, CX3CR1, CCR6, 
HLA-DOA, HLA-DQA2). KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that NPM3 expression was 
associated with cell cycle, CAMs, and NSCLC pathway genes. Finally, in vitro 
experiments showed that NPM3 knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and 
migration in NCI-H1299 and SPC-A1 cells, and suppressed the expression of CCNA2 
and MAD2L1.
CONCLUSION: Elevated NPM3 expression predicts poor clinical outcome and an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment in LUAD tissues. NPM3 promotes LUAD 
progression by promoting cell proliferation and migration, and targeting NPM3 
may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for LUAD.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and genetically characterize subgroups of patients with 
ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) based on sex and ANCA subtype.
METHODS: A previously established SNP dataset derived from DNA sequencing of 
1853 genes and genotyping of 1088 Scandinavian cases with AAV and 1589 controls 
was stratified for sex and ANCA subtype and analysed for association with five 
top AAV SNPs. rs9274619, a lead variant at the HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 locus 
previously associated with AAV positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA, was 
analysed for association with the cumulative disease involvement of ten 
different organ systems.
RESULTS: rs9274619 showed a significantly stronger association to 
MPO-ANCA-positive females than males [P = 2.0 × 10-4, OR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.5, 
3.5)], whereas proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA-associated variants rs1042335, rs9277341 
(HLA-DPB1/A1) and rs28929474 (SERPINA1) were equally associated with females and 
males with PR3-ANCA. In MPO-ANCA-positive cases, carriers of the rs9274619 risk 
allele were more prone to disease engagement of eyes [P = 0.021, OR = 11 (95% CI 
2.2, 205)] but less prone to pulmonary involvement [P = 0.026, OR = 0.52 (95% CI 
0.30, 0.92)]. Moreover, AAV with both MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA was associated with 
the PR3-ANCA lead SNP rs1042335 [P = 0.0015, OR = 0.091 (95% CI 0.0022, 0.55)] 
but not with rs9274619.
CONCLUSIONS: Females and males with MPO-ANCA-positive AAV differ in genetic 
predisposition to disease, suggesting at least partially distinct disease 
mechanisms between the sexes. Double ANCA-positive AAV cases are genetically 
similar to PR3-ANCA-positive cases, providing clues to the clinical follow-up 
and treatment of these patients.

BACKGROUND: RNA modification plays important roles in many biological processes, 
such as gene expression control. The aim of this study was to identify single 
nucleotide polymorphisms related to RNA modification (RNAm-SNPs) for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) as putative functional variants.
METHODS: We examined the association of RNAm-SNPs with RA in summary data from a 
genome-wide association study of 19,234 RA cases and 61,565 controls. We 
performed eQTL and pQTL analyses for the RNAm-SNPs to find associated gene 
expression and protein levels. Furthermore, we examined the associations of gene 
expression and circulating protein levels with RA using two-sample Mendelian 
randomization analysis methods.
RESULTS: A total of 160 RNAm-SNPs related to m6A, m1A, A-to-I, m7G, m5C, m5U and 
m6Am modifications were identified to be significantly associated with RA. These 
RNAm-SNPs were located in 62 protein-coding genes, which were significantly 
enriched in immune-related pathways. RNAm-SNPs in important RA susceptibility 
genes, such as PADI2, SPRED2, PLCL2, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, TRAF1 and 
TXNDC11, were identified. Most of these RNAm-SNPs showed eQTL effects, and the 
expression levels of 26 of the modifiable genes (e.g., PADI2, TRAF1, HLA-A, 
HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-B) in blood cells were associated with RA. 
Circulating protein levels, such as CFB, GZMA, HLA-DQA2, IL21, LRPAP1 and TFF3, 
were affected by RNAm-SNPs and were associated with RA.
CONCLUSION: The present study identified RNAm-SNPs in the reported RA 
susceptibility genes and suggested that RNAm-SNPs may affect RA risk by 
affecting the expression levels of corresponding genes and proteins.

As an effective supplement to the current forensic DNA typing and one of the 
research hotpots in forensic science, the in-depth mining and characterization 
of biological evidence can provide rich and reliable clues for case 
investigation. In this study, the time-dependent variations of transcriptome 
were confirmed in in vitro blood samples within 0-168 days and a random forest 
model was established to realize the classification of blood samples with 
different TSD (time since deposition). Meanwhile, significant differences were 
observed in the transcripts of blood samples with different smoking habits and 
genders within a certain time period. HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 were 
identified as markers for smoking habit identification, while the transcripts 
for RPS4Y1 and EIF1AY from the non-recombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY) 
were identified as markers for male sex identification. Thus, this study 
provides a theoretical foundation and experimental strategy for establishing a 
transcriptome-based method for characterizing blood sample retention time and 
donor characteristics in the field of forensic investigation.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease with a 
heterogenous clinical presentation and unpredictable response to available 
therapies. This personalized transcriptomics study sought proof-of-concept for 
single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize patient-specific immune profiles.
METHODS: Whole blood samples from six untreated children, newly diagnosed with 
JIA, and two healthy controls were cultured for 24 h with or without ex vivo TNF 
stimulation and subjected to scRNAseq to examine cellular populations and 
transcript expression in PBMCs. A novel analytical pipeline, scPool, was 
developed wherein cells are first pooled into pseudocells prior to expression 
analysis, facilitating variance partitioning of the effects of TNF stimulus, JIA 
disease status, and individual donor.
RESULTS: Seventeen robust immune cell-types were identified, the abundance of 
which was significantly affected by TNF stimulus, which resulted in notable 
elevation of memory CD8 + T-cells and NK56 cells, but down-regulation of naïve 
B-cell proportions. Memory CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells were also both reduced in the 
JIA cases relative to two controls. Significant differential expression 
responses to TNF stimulus were also characterized, with monocytes showing more 
transcriptional shifts than T-lymphocyte subsets, while the B-cell response was 
more limited. We also show that donor variability exceeds the small degree of 
possible intrinsic differentiation between JIA and control profiles. An 
incidental finding of interest was association of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRB5 
expression with JIA status.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of personalized 
immune-profiling combined with ex-vivo immune stimulation for evaluation of 
patient-specific modes of immune cell activity in autoimmune rheumatic disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to identify molecular mechanisms in brain 
tissue of Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) when compared to people with non-RE 
epilepsy (PWE) and control cases using whole exome sequencing (WES), RNAseq, and 
proteomics.
METHODS: Frozen brain tissue (ages = 2-19 years) was obtained from control 
autopsy (n = 14), surgical PWE (n = 10), and surgical RE cases (n = 27). We 
evaluated WES variants in RE associated with epilepsy, seizures, RE, and human 
leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Differential expression was evaluated by RNAseq 
(adjusted p < .05) and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (false 
discovery rate < 5%) in the three groups.
RESULTS: WES revealed no common pathogenic variants in RE, but several rare and 
likely deleterious variants of unknown significance (VUS; ANGPTL7/MTOR, SCN1A, 
FCGR3B, MTOR) and more common HLA VUS in >25% of RE cases (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2), 
all with allele frequency < 5% in the general population. RNAseq in RE versus 
PWE (1516 altered transcripts) revealed significant activation of crosstalk 
between dendritic and natural killer cells (p = 7.94 × 10-6 , z = 2.65), in RE 
versus control (7466 transcripts) neuroinflammation signaling activation 
(p = 6.31 × 10-13 , z = 5.07), and in PWE versus control (945 transcripts) 
phagosome formation activation (p = 2.00 × 10-13 , z = 5.61). Proteomics 
detected fewer altered targets.
SIGNIFICANCE: In RE, we identified activated immune signaling pathways and 
immune cell type annotation enrichment that suggest roles of the innate and 
adaptive immune responses, as well as HLA variants that may increase 
vulnerability to RE. Follow-up studies could evaluate cell type density and 
subregional localization associated with top targets, clinical history 
(neuropathology, disease duration), and whether modulating crosstalk between 
dendritic and natural killer cells may limit disease progression.

PURPOSE: We aimed to discover loci associated with triglyceride (TG) levels in 
the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) in 424,120 genotyped participants of the UK Biobank (UKB) with T2D 
status and TG levels.
METHODS: We stratified the cohort based on T2D status and conducted association 
analyses of TG levels for genetic variants with minor allele count (MAC) at 
least 20 in each stratum. Effect differences of genetic variants by T2D status 
were determined by Cochran's Q-test and we validated the significantly 
associated variants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB).
RESULTS: Among 21,176 T2D and 402,944 non-T2D samples from UKB, stratified GWAS 
identified 19 and 315 genomic risk loci significantly associated with TG levels, 
respectively. Only chr6p21.32 exhibited genome-wide significant heterogeneity 
(I2 = 98.4%; pheterogeneity = 2.1x10-15), with log(TG) effect estimates of 
-0.066 (95%CI: -0.082, -0.050) and 0.002 (95%CI: -0.002, 0.006) for T2D and 
non-T2D, respectively. The lead variant rs9274619:A (allele frequency 0.095) is 
located 2Kb upstream of the HLA-DQB1 gene, between HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 genes. 
We replicated this finding among 25,137 participants (6,951 T2D cases) of MGBB 
(pheterogeneity = 9.5x10-3). Phenome-wide interaction association analyses 
showed that the lead variant was strongly associated with a concomitant 
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) as well as diabetes-associated complications.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we identified an intergenic variant near 
HLA-DQB1/DQA2 significantly associates with decreased triglycerides only among 
those with T2D and highlights an immune overlap with T1D.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II plays critical roles in antigen 
presentation and the initiation of immune responses. However, the correlation 
between the HLA class II gene expression level and the survival of patients with 
breast cancer is still under investigation. We analyzed microarray and RNA-Seq 
data of breast cancer from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), genotype-tissue 
expression (GTEx) and Oncomine databases by using bioinformatics tools. The 
expression of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB2 genes was significantly 
upregulated in breast cancer. Higher expression levels of HLA class II genes in 
breast cancer, especially HLA-DOB and HLA-DQB2, were significantly associated 
with better overall survival. Furthermore, the expression of HLA class II genes 
was more closely associated with survival in breast cancer than in other cancer 
types. CD48 coexpressed with both HLA-DOB and HLA-DQB2 was also positively 
associated with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. The results 
indicated that HLA class II and CD48 may enhance antitumor immunity, and their 
expression patterns may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets in breast cancer.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) is frequently mutated in glioma tissues, and 
this mutation mediates specific tumor-promoting mechanisms in glioma cells. We 
aimed to identify specific immune biomarkers for IDH1-mutation (IDH1mt) glioma. 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were used 
to obtain RNA sequencing data and clinical characteristics of glioma tissues, 
while the stromal and immune scores of TCGA glioma tissues were determined using 
the ESTIMATE algorithm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the 
protein-protein interaction(PPI) network, and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses were used to select hub 
genes associated with stroma and immune scores and the prognoses of patients and 
to construct the risk model. The practicability and specificity of the risk 
model in both IDH1mt and IDH1-wildtype (wtIDH1) gliomas in TCGA and CGGA were 
evaluated. Molecular mechanisms, immunological characteristics and benefits of 
immune checkpoint blockade therapy in glioma tissues with IDH1mt were analyzed 
using GSEA, immunohistochemical staining, CIBERSORT, and T-cell dysfunction and 
exclusion (TIDE) analysis. The overall survival rate for IDH1mt-glioma patients 
with high stroma/immune scores was lower than that for those with low 
stroma/immune scores. A total of 222 DEGs were identified in IDH1mt glioma 
tissues with high stroma/immune scores. Among them, 72 genes had interactions in 
the PPI network, while three genes, HLA-DQA2, HOXA3, and SAA2, were selected as 
hub genes and used to construct risk models classifying patients into high- and 
low-risk score groups, followed by LASSO and Cox regression analyses. This risk 
model showed prognostic value in IDH1mt glioma in both TCGA and CCGA; 
nevertheless, the model was not suitable for wtIDH1 glioma. The risk model may 
act as an independent prognostic factor for IDH1mt glioma. IDH1mt glioma tissues 
from patients with high-risk scores showed more infiltration of M1 and CD8 T 
cells than those from patients with low-risk scores. Moreover, TIDE analysis 
showed that immune checkpoint blockade(ICB) therapy was highly beneficial for 
IDH1mt patients with high-risk scores. The risk model showed specific potential 
to predict the prognosis of IDH1mt-glioma patients, as well as guide ICB, 
contributing to the diagnosis and therapy of IDH1mt-glioma patients.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation within areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular 
atrophy (IF/TA) is associated with kidney allograft failure. The aim of this 
study was to reveal new diagnostic markers of IF/TA based on bioinformatics 
analysis.
METHODS: Raw data of IF/TA samples after kidney transplantation and control 
samples after kidney transplantation were extracted from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE76882 and GSE120495 datasets), and genes that were 
differentially expressed between the two groups (DEGs) were screened. Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), ESTIMATE and single sample GSEA (ssGSEA), least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and 
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The results of GSEA revealed that multiple immune-related pathways were 
enriched in the IF/TA group, and subsequent immune landscape analysis also 
showed that the IF/TA group had higher immune and stromal scores and up to 15 
types of immune cells occupied them, such as B cells, cytotoxic cells, and T 
cells. LASSO regression analysis selected 6 (including ANGPTL3, APOH, LTF, 
FCGR2B, HLA-DQA2, and EGF) out of 14 DE-IRGs as diagnostic genes to construct a 
diagnostic model. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
showed the powerful diagnostic value of the model, and the area under the curve 
(AUC) of a single diagnostic gene was greater than 0.75. The results of 
ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) also indicated that DEGs were involved in the 
immune system and kidney disease-related pathways. Finally, we found multiple 
miRNAs that could regulate diagnostic genes from the ceRNA network.
CONCLUSION: This study identified 6 IF/TA-related genes, which might be used as 
a new diagnosis model in the clinical practice.

Dysregulation of Circulating Immune Cell Subpopulations.

BACKGROUND: An increased risk of infection, malignancy, and cardiovascular 
diseases in maintenance hemodialysis patients is associated with 
hemodialysis-related immunity disturbances. Although defects in 
T-lymphocyte-dependent immune responses and preactivation of antigen-presenting 
cells have been documented in hemodialysis patients, the effects of long-term 
hemodialysis on the transcriptional program and chromosomal accessibility of 
circulating immune cell subpopulations remain poorly defined.
METHODS: We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to 
characterize the transcriptome profiles of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
from healthy controls and maintenance hemodialysis patients. Validation of 
differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells and monocytes were performed by 
magnetic bead separation and quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: We identified 16 and 15 PBMC subgroups in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq 
datasets, respectively. Hemodialysis significantly suppressed the expression 
levels of T cell receptor (TCR) genes in CD4+ T cell subsets (e.g., TRAV4, CD45, 
CD3G, CD3D, CD3E) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) 
pathway-related genes in monocytes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPB1). 
Downstream pathways of TCR signaling, including PI3K-Akt-mTOR, MAPK, TNF, and 
NF-κB pathways, were also inhibited in CD4+ T cell subpopulations during the 
hemodialysis procedure. Hemodialysis altered cellular communication patterns 
between PBMC subgroups, particularly TGF-TGFBR, HVEM-BTLA, and IL16-CD4 
signalings between CD4+ T cells and monocytes. Additionally, we found that 
hemodialysis inhibited the expression of AP-1 family transcription factors (JUN, 
JUND, FOS, FOSB) by interfering with the chromatin accessibility profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a valuable framework for future investigations 
of hemodialysis-related immune dysregulation and identifies potential 
therapeutic targets for reconstituting the circulating immune system in 
maintenance hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies of asthma have revealed robust 
associations with variation across the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex 
with independent associations in the HLA class I and class II regions for both 
childhood-onset asthma (COA) and adult-onset asthma (AOA). However, the specific 
variants and genes contributing to risk are unknown.
METHODS: We used Bayesian approaches to perform genetic fine-mapping for COA and 
AOA (n=9432 and 21,556, respectively; n=318,167 shared controls) in White 
British individuals from the UK Biobank and to perform expression quantitative 
trait locus (eQTL) fine-mapping in immune (lymphoblastoid cell lines, n=398; 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, n=132) and airway (nasal epithelial cells, 
n=188) cells from ethnically diverse individuals. We also examined putatively 
causal protein coding variation from protein crystal structures and conducted 
replication studies in independent multi-ethnic cohorts from the UK Biobank (COA 
n=1686; AOA n=3666; controls n=56,063).
RESULTS: Genetic fine-mapping revealed both shared and distinct causal variation 
between COA and AOA in the class I region but only distinct causal variation in 
the class II region. Both gene expression levels and amino acid variation 
contributed to risk. Our results from eQTL fine-mapping and amino acid 
visualization suggested that the HLA-DQA1*03:01 allele and variation associated 
with expression of the nonclassical HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes accounted 
entirely for the most significant association with AOA in GWAS. Our studies also 
suggested a potentially prominent role for HLA-C protein coding variation in the 
class I region in COA. We replicated putatively causal variant associations in a 
multi-ethnic cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight roles for both gene expression and protein coding 
variation in asthma risk and identified putatively causal variation and genes in 
the HLA region. A convergence of genomic, transcriptional, and protein coding 
evidence implicates the HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes and HLA-DQA1*03:01 allele in 
AOA.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Numerous genome-wide association studies have been performed to 
understand the influence of genetic variation on type 2 diabetes etiology. Many 
identified risk variants are located in non-coding and intergenic regions, which 
complicates understanding of how genes and their downstream pathways are 
influenced. An integrative data approach will help to understand the mechanism 
and consequences of identified risk variants.
METHODS: In the current study we use our previously developed method CONQUER to 
overlap 403 type 2 diabetes risk variants with regulatory, expression and 
protein data to identify tissue-shared disease-relevant mechanisms.
RESULTS: One SNP rs474513 was found to be an expression-, protein- and 
metabolite QTL. Rs474513 influenced LPA mRNA and protein levels in the pancreas 
and plasma, respectively. On the pathway level, in investigated tissues most 
SNPs linked to metabolism. However, in eleven of the twelve tissues investigated 
nine SNPs were linked to differential expression of the ribosome pathway. 
Furthermore, seven SNPs were linked to altered expression of genes linked to the 
immune system. Among them, rs601945 was found to influence multiple HLA genes, 
including HLA-DQA2, in all twelve tissues investigated.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that in addition to the classical metabolism 
pathways, other pathways may be important to type 2 diabetes that show a 
potential overlap with type 1 diabetes.

INTRODUCTION: Although genome-wide association studies have been conducted to 
investigate genetic variation of lung tumorigenesis, little is known about 
gene-gene (G × G) interactions that may influence the risk of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Leveraging a total of 445,221 European-descent participants from the 
International Lung Cancer Consortium OncoArray project, Transdisciplinary 
Research in Cancer of the Lung and UK Biobank, we performed a large-scale 
genome-wide G × G interaction study on European NSCLC risk by a series of 
analyses. First, we used BiForce to evaluate and rank more than 58 billion G × G 
interactions from 340,958 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Then, the top 
interactions were further tested by demographically adjusted logistic regression 
models. Finally, we used the selected interactions to build lung cancer 
screening models of NSCLC, separately, for never and ever smokers.
RESULTS: With the Bonferroni correction, we identified eight statistically 
significant pairs of SNPs, which predominantly appeared in the 6p21.32 and 
5p15.33 regions (e.g., rs521828C6orf10 and rs204999PRRT1, ORinteraction = 1.17, 
p = 6.57 × 10-13; rs3135369BTNL2 and rs2858859HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 1.17, 
p = 2.43 × 10-13; rs2858859HLA-DQA1 and rs9275572HLA-DQA2, ORinteraction = 1.15, 
p = 2.84 × 10-13; rs2853668TERT and rs62329694CLPTM1L, ORinteraction = 0.73, p = 
2.70 × 10-13). Notably, even with much genetic heterogeneity across ethnicities, 
three pairs of SNPs in the 6p21.32 region identified from the European-ancestry 
population remained significant among an Asian population from the Nanjing 
Medical University Global Screening Array project (rs521828C6orf10 and 
rs204999PRRT1, ORinteraction = 1.13, p = 0.008; rs3135369BTNL2 and 
rs2858859HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 1.11, p = 5.23 × 10-4; rs3135369BTNL2 and 
rs9271300HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 0.89, p = 0.006). The interaction-empowered 
polygenetic risk score that integrated classical polygenetic risk score and G × 
G information score was remarkable in lung cancer risk stratification.
CONCLUSIONS: Important G × G interactions were identified and enriched in the 
5p15.33 and 6p21.32 regions, which may enhance lung cancer screening models.

Elucidating regulatory effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated genetic 
variants is critical for unraveling their causal pathways and understanding the 
pathology. However, their cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in the brain 
remain largely unclear. Here, we conducted an analysis of allele-specific 
expression quantitative trait loci (aseQTLs) for 33 AD-associated variants in 
four brain regions and seven cell types using ~3000 bulk RNA-seq samples and 
>0.25 million single nuclei. We first develop a flexible hierarchical Poisson 
mixed model (HPMM) and demonstrate its superior statistical power to a 
beta-binomial model achieved by unifying samples in both allelic and 
genotype-level expression data. Using the HPMM, we identified 24 (~73%) aseQTLs 
in at least one brain region, including three new eQTLs associated with CA12, 
CHRNE, and CASS4. Notably, the APOE ε4 variant reduces APOE expression across 
all regions, even in AD-unaffected controls. Our results reveal region-dependent 
and exon-specific effects of multiple aseQTLs, such as rs2093760 with CR1, 
rs7982 with CLU, and rs3865444 with CD33. In an attempt to pinpoint the cell 
types responsible for the observed tissue-level aseQTLs using the snRNA-seq 
data, we detected many aseQTLs in microglia or monocytes associated with 
immune-related genes, including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, CD33, FCER1G, MS4A6A, SPI1, 
and BIN1, highlighting the regulatory role of AD-associated variants in the 
immune response. These findings provide further insights into potential causal 
pathways and cell types mediating the effects of the AD-associated variants.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and 
DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained 
through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and 
Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of 
approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and 
compared with the common susceptibility genes.
RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes 
(HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more 
than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting 
three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub 
common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 
435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility 
pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps 
including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. 
Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common 
susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were 
used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for 
SS.
CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular 
bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential 
therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.

Immune system plays important roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease 
(PD). However, the role of B cells in this complex disease are still not fully 
understood. B cells produce antibodies but can also regulate immune responses. 
In order to decode the relative contribution of peripheral B cell subtypes to 
the etiology of PD, we performed single cell RNA and BCR sequencing for 10,466 B 
cells from 8 PD patients and 6 age-matched healthy controls. We observed 
significant increased memory B cells and significant decreased naïve B cells in 
PD patients compared to healthy controls. Notably, we also discovered increased 
IgG and IgA isotypes and more frequent class switch recombination events in PD 
patients. Moreover, we identified preferential V and J gene segments of B cell 
receptors in PD patients as the evidence of convergent selection in PD. Finally, 
we found a marked clonal expanded memory B cell population in PD patients, 
up-regulating both MHC II genes (HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DPB1) and 
transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1), suggesting that the antigen 
presentation capacity of B cells was enhanced and B cells were activated in PD 
patients. Overall, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of peripheral B 
cell characteristics of PD patients, which provided novel insights into the 
humoral immune response in the pathogenesis of PD.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize genetic loci associated with the risk of 
developing ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV).
METHODS: Genetic association analyses were performed after Illumina sequencing 
of 1853 genes and subsequent replication with genotyping of selected single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in a total cohort of 1110 Scandinavian cases with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, and 1589 controls. 
A novel AAV-associated single nucleotide polymorphism was analysed for 
allele-specific effects on gene expression using luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: PR3-ANCA+ AAV was significantly associated with two independent loci in 
the HLA-DPB1/HLA-DPA1 region [rs1042335, P = 6.3 × 10-61, odds ratio (OR) 0.10; 
rs9277341, P = 1.5 × 10-44, OR 0.22] and with rs28929474 in the SERPINA1 gene 
(P = 2.7 × 10-10, OR 2.9). MPO-ANCA+ AAV was significantly associated with the 
HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 locus (rs9274619, P = 5.4 × 10-25, OR 3.7) and with a rare 
variant in the BACH2 gene (rs78275221, P = 7.9 × 10-7, OR 3.0), the latter a 
novel susceptibility locus for MPO-ANCA+ granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis. The rs78275221-A risk allele reduced 
luciferase gene expression in endothelial cells, specifically, as compared with 
the non-risk allele.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel susceptibility locus for MPO-ANCA+ AAV and 
propose that the associated variant is of mechanistic importance, exerting a 
regulatory function on gene expression in specific cell types.

Transcriptomic profiling reveals gene expression in human peripheral blood after 
exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation.

Fang F, Yu X, Wang X, Zhu X, Liu L, Rong L, Niu D, Li J.

Although the health effects of exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation have been 
the focus of many studies, the affected biological functions and underlying 
regulatory mechanisms are not well-understood. In particular, the influence of 
radiation exposure at doses of less than 200 mGy on the regulation of genes and 
pathways remains unclear. To investigate the molecular alterations induced by 
varying doses of low-dose radiation (LDR), transcriptomic analysis was conducted 
based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing following exposure to 50 and 150 mGy 
doses. Human peripheral blood was collected, and the samples were divided into 
three groups, including two treatments and one control (no radiation). A total 
of 876 (318 upregulated and 558 downregulated) and 486 (202 upregulated and 284 
downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after 
exposure to 50 mGy and 150 mGy, respectively. Most upregulated genes in both the 
50 mGy and 150 mGy groups were associated with 'antigen processing and 
presentation,' which appeared to be the major targets affected by LDR exposure. 
Several interacting genes, including HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB1, and 
HLA-DRB5 were mapped to 'antigen processing and presentation,' 'immune 
system-related diseases' and the 'cytokine-mediated signaling pathway,' 
suggesting that these genes might drive the downstream transmission of these 
signal transduction pathways. Our results suggest that exposure to LDR may 
elicit changes in key genes and associated pathways, probably helping further 
explore the biological processes and molecular mechanism responsible for 
low-dose occupational or environmental exposures in humans.

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is classified as a sort of serious nervous 
system syndrome that occurs in the early life period. Noncoding RNAs had been 
confirmed to have crucial roles in human diseases. So far, there were few 
systematical and comprehensive studies towards the expression profile of RNAs in 
the brain after hypoxia ischemia. In this study, 31 differentially expressed 
microRNAs (miRNAs) with upregulation were identified. In addition, 5512 
differentially expressed mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) were identified in HIE groups. Bioinformatics analysis showed these 
circRNAs and mRNAs were significantly enriched in regulation of leukocyte 
activation, response to virus, and neutrophil degranulation. Pathway and its 
related gene network analysis indicated that HLA - DPA1, HLA - DQA2, HLA - DQB1, 
and HLA - DRB4 have a more crucial role in HIE. Finally, miRNA-circRNA-mRNA 
interaction network analysis was also performed to identify hub miRNAs and 
circRNAs. We found that miR-592 potentially targeting 5 circRNAs, thus affecting 
15 mRNA expressions in HIR. hsa_circ_0068397 and hsa_circ_0045698 were 
identified as hub circRNAs in HIE. Collectively, using RNA-seq, bioinformatics 
analysis, and circRNA/miRNA interaction prediction, we systematically

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to screen and validate the crucial genes involved 
in osteoarthritis (OA) and explore its potential molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Four expression profile datasets related to OA were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 4 
microarray patterns were identified by the meta-analysis method. The weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method was used to investigate 
stable modules most related to OA. In addition, a protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network was built to explore hub genes in OA. Moreover, OA-related genes 
and pathways were retrieved from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).
RESULTS: A total of 1,136 DEGs were identified from 4 datasets. Based on these 
DEGs, WGCNA further explored 370 genes included in the 3 OA-related stable 
modules. A total of 10 hub genes were identified in the PPI network, including 
AKT1, CDC42, HLA-DQA2, TUBB, TWISTNB, GSK3B, FZD2, KLC1, GUSB, and RHOG. 
Besides, 5 pathways including "Lysosome," "Pathways in cancer," "Wnt signaling 
pathway," "ECM-receptor interaction" and "Focal adhesion" in CTD and enrichment 
analysis and 5 OA-related hub genes (including GSK3B, CDC42, AKT1, FZD2, and 
GUSB) were identified.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the meta-analysis was used to screen the central 
genes associated with OA in a variety of gene expression profiles. Three 
OA-related modules (green, turquoise, and yellow) containing 370 genes were 
identified through WGCNA. It was discovered through the gene-pathway network 
that GSK3B, CDC42, AKT1, FZD2, and GUSB may be key genes related to the progress 
of OA and may become promising therapeutic targets.

WNT signaling in neuroinflammation and in age-related impairment of striatal 
neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

BACKGROUND: Motor and cognitive decline as part of the normal aging process is 
linked to alterations in synaptic plasticity and reduction of adult neurogenesis 
in the dorsal striatum. Neuroinflammation, particularly in the form of 
microglial activation, is suggested to contribute to these age-associated 
changes.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To explore the molecular basis of alterations in striatal 
function during aging we analyzed RNA-Seq data for 117 postmortem human dorsal 
caudate samples and 97 putamen samples acquired through GTEx.
RESULTS: Increased expression of neuroinflammatory transcripts including TREM2, 
MHC II molecules HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DMA and HLA-DRA, 
complement genes C1QA, C1QB, CIQC and C3AR1, and MHCI molecules HLA-B and HLA-F 
was identified. We also identified down-regulation of transcripts involved in 
neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic pruning, including DCX, CX3CL1, and 
CD200, and the canonical WNTs WNT7A, WNT7B, and WNT8A. The canonical WNT 
signaling pathway has previously been shown to mediate adult neurogenesis and 
synapse formation and growth. Recent findings also highlight the link between 
WNT/β-catenin signaling and inflammation pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that age-dependent attenuation of canonical 
WNT signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating striatal plasticity during 
aging. Dysregulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling via astrocyte-microglial 
interactions is suggested to be a novel mechanism that drives the decline of 
striatal neurogenesis and altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity, leading 
to a subsequent decrease in motor and cognitive performance with age. These 
findings may aid in the development of therapies targeting WNT/β-catenin 
signaling to combat cognitive and motor impairments associated with aging.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in many deaths 
throughout the world. It is vital to identify the novel prognostic biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets to assist with the subsequent diagnosis and treatment 
plan to mitigate the expansion of COVID-19. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 
2 (ACE2)-positive cells are hosts for COVID-19, we focussed on this cell type to 
explore the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19. In this study, we identified that 
ACE2-positive cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients 
with COVID-19 belong to bronchial epithelial cells. Comparing with patients of 
COVID-19 showing severe symptoms, the antigen processing and presentation 
pathway was increased and 12 typical genes, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB1, CD74, HLA-DRA, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, and 
HLA-DMA, particularly HLA-DPB1, were obviously up-regulated in ACE2-positive 
bronchial epithelial cells of patients with mild disease. We further discovered 
SDCBP was positively correlated with above 12 genes particularly with HLA-DPB1 
in ACE2-positive bronchial epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, 
SDCBP may increase the immune infiltration of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T 
cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells in different lung carcinoma. 
Moreover, we found the expression of SDCBP was positively correlated with the 
expression of antigen processing and presentation genes in post-mortem lung 
biopsies tissues, which is consistent with previous discoveries. These results 
suggest that SDCBP has good potential to be further developed as a novel 
diagnostic and therapeutic target in the treatment of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: An HLA imputation was conducted to explore the relationship between 
HLA and patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) in the Chinese Han population.
METHODS: In this study, we performed an association analysis of the major 
histocompatibility complex region in 2,786 individuals of Chinese Han ancestry 
(2,031 controls and 755 patients with MMD), through a widely used HLA imputation 
method.
RESULTS: We identified that the variant rs3129731 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, p = 
3.69 × 10-16) located between the MTCO3P1 and HLA-DQA2 is a major genetic risk 
factor for MMD. In addition to this variant, found in the conditional 
association analysis, we also detected another independent signal, rs1071817 (OR 
= 0.62, p = 1.20 × 10-11), in HLA-B.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that the genetic polymorphism of HLA-DQA2 and 
HLA-B could be a genetic predisposing factor for MMD in Chinese Han. This may 
provide some evidence for further HLA-related studies of patients with MMD of 
Chinese Han ethnicity and indicates that MMD is an immune-related disease.

Differential methylation of immune genes has been a consistent theme observed in 
Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, whole blood, and labial 
salivary glands (LSGs). Multiple studies have found associations supporting 
genetic control of DNA methylation in SS, which in the absence of reverse 
causation, has positive implications for the potential of epigenetic therapy. 
However, a formal study of the causal relationship between genetic variation, 
DNA methylation, and disease status is lacking. We performed a causal mediation 
analysis of DNA methylation as a mediator of nearby genetic association with SS 
using LSGs and genotype data collected from 131 female members of the Sjögren's 
International Collaborative Clinical Alliance registry, comprising of 64 SS 
cases and 67 non-cases. Bumphunter was used to first identify 
differentially-methylated regions (DMRs), then the causal inference test (CIT) 
was applied to identify DMRs mediating the association of nearby methylation 
quantitative trait loci (MeQTL) with SS. Bumphunter discovered 215 DMRs, with 
the majority located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 
6p21.3. Consistent with previous findings, regions hypomethylated in SS cases 
were enriched for gene sets associated with immune processes. Using the CIT, we 
observed a total of 19 DMR-MeQTL pairs that exhibited strong evidence for a 
causal mediation relationship. Close to half of these DMRs reside in the MHC and 
their corresponding meQTLs are in the region spanning the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, 
and HLA-DQA2 loci. The risk of SS conferred by these corresponding MeQTLs in the 
MHC was further substantiated by previous genome-wide association study results, 
with modest evidence for independent effects. By validating the presence of 
causal mediation, our findings suggest both genetic and epigenetic factors 
contribute to disease susceptibility, and inform the development of targeted 
epigenetic modification as a therapeutic approach for SS.

OBJECTIVE: Juvenile localized scleroderma (LS) is an autoimmune disease of the 
skin whose pathogenesis is not well understood due to the rarity of the disease. 
This study was undertaken to determine the skin transcriptome in skin biopsy 
tissue from children with juvenile LS compared to pediatric healthy controls, 
with identification of significant molecular targets using RNA sequencing 
(RNA-Seq). In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were assessed 
for correlations with histopathologic and clinical features in children with 
juvenile LS, and were used to group the children into distinct genetic clusters 
based on immunophenotype.
METHODS: RNA-Seq was performed on sections of paraffin-embedded skin tissue 
obtained from 28 children with juvenile LS and 10 pediatric healthy controls. 
RNA-Seq was carried out using an Illumina HTS TruSeq RNA Access library prep 
kit, with data aligned using STAR and data analysis using a DESeq2 platform. A 
standardized histologic scoring system was used to score skin sections for the 
severity of inflammation and levels of collagen deposition. Histologic scoring 
was completed by 2 pathologists who were blinded with regard to the status of 
each sample. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to assess 
significant correlations between DEG expression profiles and skin histologic 
findings in patients with juvenile LS.
RESULTS: We identified 589 significant DEGs in children with juvenile LS as 
compared to healthy controls. Hierarchical clustering was used to demonstrate 3 
distinct juvenile LS immunophenotype clusters. The histologic scores of skin 
inflammation (based on numbers and categories of inflammatory cell infiltrates) 
were significantly correlated with the expression levels of HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2, 
HLA-DRA, and STAT1 genes (rs > 0.5, P < 0.01). Collagen thickness correlated 
with the expression levels of collagen organization genes as well as with genes 
found to be correlated with the severity of inflammation, including genes for 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, and interferon-γ 
signaling.
CONCLUSION: Among children with juvenile LS, 3 distinct genetic signatures, or 
clusters, were identified. In one cluster, inflammation-related pathways were 
up-regulated, corresponding to the histologic skin inflammation score. In the 
second cluster, fibrosis-related pathways were up-regulated. In the third 
cluster, gene expression in the skin corresponded to the patterns seen in 
healthy controls. Up-regulation of HLA class II genes was observed within the 
first cluster (characterized by predominant inflammation), a feature that has 
also been observed in the peripheral blood of patients with morphea and in the 
skin of patients with systemic sclerosis.

Glomerulonephritis is the one of the major causes of the end-stage kidney 
disease, whereas the pathological process of glomerulonephritis is still not 
completely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) emerges to be a 
powerful tool to evaluate the full heterogeneity of kidney diseases. To reveal 
cellular gene expression profiles of glomerulonephritis, we performed scRNA-seq 
of 2 human kidney transplantation donor samples, 4 human glomerulonephritis 
samples, 1 human malignant hypertension (MH) sample and 1 human chronic 
interstitial nephritis (CIN) sample, all tissues were taken from the biopsy. 
After filtering the cells with < 200 genes and > 10% mitochondria (MT) genes, 
the resulting 14 932 cells can be divided into 20 cell clusters, consistently 
with the previous report, in disease samples dramatic immune cells infiltration 
was found, among which a proximal tubule (PT) subset characterized by wnt-β 
catenin activation and a natural killer T (NKT) subset high expressing LTB were 
found. Furthermore, in the cluster of the podocyte, three glomerulonephritis 
related genes named FXYD5, CD74 and B2M were found. Compared with the mesangial 
of donor, the gene CLIC1 and RPS26 were up-regulated in mesangial of IgA 
nephropathy(IgAN), whereas the gene JUNB was up-regulated in podocyte of IgAN in 
comparison with that of donor. Meanwhile, some membranous nephropathy (MN) high 
expressed genes such as HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA2, IFNG, CCL2 and NR4A2, which involve 
in highest enrichment pathway, display the cellular-specific expression style, 
whereas monocyte marker of lupus nephritis (LN) named TNFSF13B was also found 
and interferon alpha/beta signalling pathway was enriched in B and NKT of LN 
comparing with donor. By scRNA-seq, we first defined the podocyte markers of 
glomerulonephritis and specific markers in IgA, MN and LN were found at cellular 
level. Furthermore, the critical role of interferon alpha/beta signalling 
pathway was enriched in B and NKT of LN was declared.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a type of scarring lung disease 
characterized by a chronic, progressive, and irreversible decline in lung 
function. The genetic basis of IPF remains elusive. A transcriptome-wide 
association study (TWAS) of IPF was performed by FUSION using gene expression 
weights of three tissues combined with a large-scale genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) dataset, totally involving 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls. 
Significant genes identified by TWAS were then subjected to gene ontology (GO) 
and pathway enrichment analysis. The overlapped GO terms and pathways between 
enrichment analysis of TWAS significant genes and differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) from the genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of IPF were also 
identified. For TWAS significant genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network and clustering modules analyses were further conducted using STRING and 
Cytoscape. Overall, TWAS identified a group of candidate genes for IPF under the 
Bonferroni corrected P value threshold (0.05/14929 = 3.35 × 10-6), such as DSP 
(P TWAS = 1.35 × 10-29 for lung tissue), MUC5B (P TWAS = 1.09 × 10-28 for lung 
tissue), and TOLLIP (P TWAS = 1.41 × 10-15 for whole blood). Pathway enrichment 
analysis identified multiple candidate pathways, such as herpes simplex 
infection (P value = 7.93 × 10-5) and antigen processing and presentation (P 
value = 6.55 × 10-5). 38 common GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways shared by 
enrichment analysis of TWAS significant genes and DEGs were identified. In the 
PPI network, 14 genes (DYNLL1, DYNC1LI1, DYNLL2, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB2, 
HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, POLR2L, CENPP, CENPK, NUP133, and NUP107) were 
simultaneously detected by hub gene and module analysis. In conclusion, through 
integrative analysis of TWAS and mRNA expression profiles, we identified 
multiple novel candidate genes, GO terms and pathways for IPF, which contributes 
to the understanding of the genetic mechanism of IPF.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major complication and accounts for 
high morbidity and mortality of preterm infants. The present study aimed to 
identify the key genes in the development of BPD and to provide some new 
insights into the pathogenesis of BPD. The GSE108754 dataset was downloaded from 
Gene Expression Omnibus database containing 5 samples of BPD patients and 6 of 
non-BPD infants. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BPD and 
non-BPD patients were identified by R software. The pathway and function 
enrichment analyses were performed through Database for Annotation Visualization 
and Integrated Discovery website. The protein-protein interaction network for 
DEGs was established by Cytoscape software and the most highly connected module 
was selected through MCODE plugin. Furthermore, the clinical sample verification 
among 25 BPD patients and 10 non-BPD infants was carried out in our center. 
Finally, based on the results above, the gene set enrichment analysis focusing 
on CD74 upregulated status was employed. Totally, 189 DEGs including 147 
upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes between BPD and non-BPD patients 
were screened out. The pathway and function enrichments revealed these DEGs were 
mainly enriched in asthma, intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen 
processing and presentation and immune response. Thirteen DEGs (CD74, HLA-DMA, 
HLA-DRA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DOA, HLA-DPB1, 
HLA-DQB2, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB1) were determined as hub genes. The mRNA 
expression levels of the 13 hub genes were tested by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction among our clinical samples. Eventually, CD74 was 
confirmed to be the most significant highly expressed in BPD samples (P < .001) 
and its expression level was negatively correlated with gestational age 
(r = -0.653) and birth weight (r = -0.675). The gene set enrichment analysis 
results showed the gene sets associated with lupus erythematosus, viral 
myocarditis, immune network for IgA production, graft versus host disease, cell 
adhesion molecules and so no were differentially enriched with the phenotype of 
high-expression CD74. In conclusion, CD74 may serve to predict the BPD 
development and provide a new therapeutic target for BPD.

INTRODUCTION: Various genome wide association studies have manifested that Major 
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21 houses many potential 
candidate genes for asthma.
OBJECTIVE: This Case-Control association study was planned to determine the 
association of 10 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), residing within and 
around MHC genes' region on chromosome 6p21, with Asthma in Punjabi population 
of Lahore, Pakistan.
METHODS: A total of 161 subjects, 61 physician-diagnosed asthma patients and 100 
age-matched healthy controls, were recruited from Lahore, a city in Punjab. Ten 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs9378249, rs2070600, rs404860, rs6689, 
rs1049124, rs1063355, rs1049225, rs1049219, rs7773955 and rs928976) located 
within or near AGER, NOTCH and HLA genes in MHC region, were genotyped in both 
patients and controls using single base extension reaction and capillary 
electrophoresis-based genetic analyser. Statistical models were applied using 
SHEsis Plus. Results were adjusted for various cofactors (age, gender and 
environment) and by applying multiple corrections. Haplotype and linkage 
disequilibrium analyses were performed on Haploview software v4.1.
RESULTS: Three of the studied SNPs rs1049124, rs1049219 and rs7773955 show 
independent significant association with asthma under allelic and genotypic 
models. Two of the haplotypes, H7 and H13, "CTAATTT" and "CCACTAT", 
respectively, for rs2070600, rs404860, rs6689, rs1049124, rs1063355, rs1049219 
and rs7773955, are found to be significantly associated with the disease.
CONCLUSION: This study reports association of SNP variants residing on HLA-DQB1 
and HLA-DQA2 genes and haplotypes H7 and H13 on genomic region 6p21 with Asthma 
in the Punjabi population of Lahore, Pakistan.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the genetic determinants of severe asthma 
exacerbations.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with asthma 
hospitalizations.
METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study of asthma hospitalizations 
in 34,167 white British adults with asthma, 1,658 of whom had at least 1 
asthma-related hospitalization. This analysis was conducted by using logistic 
regression under an additive genetic model with adjustment for age, sex, body 
mass index, smoking status, and the first 5 principal components derived from 
genotypic data. We then analyzed data from 2 cohorts of Latino children and 
adolescents for replication and conducted quantitative trait locus and 
functional annotation analyses.
RESULTS: At the chromosome 6p21.3 locus, the single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) rs56151658 (8 kb from the promoter of HLA-DQB1) was most significantly 
associated with asthma hospitalizations (for test allele A, odds ratio = 1.36 
[95% CI = 1.22-1.52]; P = 3.11 × 10-8); 21 additional SNPs in this locus were 
associated with asthma hospitalizations at a P value less than 1 × 10-6. In the 
replication cohorts, multiple SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with 
rs56151658 were associated with severe asthma exacerbations at a P value of .01 
or less in the same direction of association as in the discovery cohort. Three 
HLA genes (HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRB6, and HLA-DOB) were also shown to mediate the 
estimated effects of the SNPs associated with asthma hospitalizations through 
effects on gene expression in lung tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified strong candidate genes for asthma hospitalizations in 
adults in the region for class II HLA genes through genomic, quantitative trait 
locus, and summary data-based mendelian randomization analyses.

Recurrence of primary membranous nephropathy after transplantation occurs in up 
to 44% of patients and is driven by PLA2R antibody. Here, we asked whether 
genetic determinants could improve risk prediction. First, we sequenced PLA2R1 
and HLA-D loci in 248 patients with primary membranous nephropathy and 
identified two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at risk for 
primary membranous nephropathy at each locus. These were rs9271188 (intergenic 
between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1,) and rs9275086 (intergenic between HLA-DQB1 and 
HLA-DQA2) at the HLA-D locus along with rs6726925 and rs13018963 at the PLA2R1 
locus. Then we investigated whether primary membranous nephropathy at-risk 
variants were associated with recurrence in a retrospective cohort of 105 
donor-recipient pairs and a replication cohort of 40 pairs. Seven SNPs located 
between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 in linkage disequilibrium with rs9271188, and 
three SNPs in the PLA2R1 region predicted recurrence when presented by the 
donor, but not when presented by the recipient. The two SNPs in the HLA-D region 
most strongly associated with recurrence (rs9271705 and rs9271550) were 
confirmed in the replication cohort. A genetic risk score based on the two best 
predictors at each locus (rs9271705, rs9271550, rs17830558, and rs3828323) 
identified a group of patients with high risk of recurrence. Thus, our results 
suggest that the graft contributes to recurrence of primary membranous 
nephropathy through the disease susceptibility HLA-D and PLA2R1 SNPs in an 
autoimmune milieu. Further studies are needed before implementation of genetic 
testing for these in donor selection.

BACKGROUND: Unlike bone tissue, little progress has been made regarding 
cartilage regeneration, and many challenges remain. Furthermore, the key roles 
of cartilage lesion caused by traumas, focal lesion, or articular overstress 
remain unclear. Traumatic injuries to the meniscus as well as its degeneration 
are important risk factors for long-term joint dysfunction, degenerative joint 
lesions, and knee osteoarthritis (OA) a chronic joint disease characterized by 
degeneration of articular cartilage and hyperosteogeny. Nearly 50% of the 
individuals with meniscus injuries develop OA over time. Due to the limited 
inherent self-repair capacity of cartilage lesion, the Biomaterial 
drug-nanomedicine is considered to be a promising alternative. Therefore, it is 
important to elucidate the gene potential regeneration mechanisms and discover 
novel precise medication, which are identified through this study to investigate 
their function and role in pathogenesis.
METHODS: We downloaded the mRNA microarray statistics GSE117999, involving 
paired cartilage lesion tissue samples from 12 OA patients and 12 patients from 
a control group. First, we analyzed these statistics to recognize the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We then exposed the gene ontology (GO) 
annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
enrichment analyses for these DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
were then constructed, from which we attained eight significant genes after a 
functional interaction analysis. Finally, we identified a potential nanomedicine 
attained from this assay set, using a wide range of inhibitor information 
archived in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) 
database.
RESULTS: Sixty-six DEGs were identified with our standards for meaning (adjusted 
P-value < 0.01, |log2 - FC| ≥1.2). Furthermore, we identified eight hub genes 
and one potential nanomedicine - Selenocysteine based on these integrative data.
CONCLUSION: We identified eight hub genes that could work as prospective 
biomarkers for the diagnostic and biomaterial drug treatment of cartilage 
lesion, involving the novel genes CAMP, DEFA3, TOLLIP, HLA-DQA2, SLC38A6, 
SLC3A1, FAM20A, and ANO8. Meanwhile, these genes were mainly associated with 
immune response, immune mediator induction, and cell chemotaxis. Significant 
support is provided for obtaining a series of novel gene targets, and we 
identify potential mechanisms for cartilage regeneration and final nanomedicine 
immunotherapy in regenerative medicine.

We elucidated the molecular cross-talk between cartilage and synovium in 
osteoarthritis, the most widespread arthritis in the world, using the powerful 
tool of single-cell RNA-sequencing. Multiple cell types were identified based on 
profiling of 10,640 synoviocytes and 26,192 chondrocytes: 12 distinct synovial 
cell types and 7 distinct articular chondrocyte phenotypes from matched tissues. 
Intact cartilage was enriched for homeostatic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, 
while damaged cartilage was enriched for prefibro- and fibro-, regulatory, 
reparative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. A total of 61 cytokines and growth 
factors were predicted to regulate the 7 chondrocyte cell phenotypes. Based on 
production by > 1% of cells, 55% of the cytokines were produced by synovial 
cells (39% exclusive to synoviocytes and not expressed by chondrocytes) and 
their presence in osteoarthritic synovial fluid confirmed. The synoviocytes 
producing IL-1beta (a classic pathogenic cytokine in osteoarthritis), mainly 
inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells, were characterized by 
co-expression of surface proteins corresponding to HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, OLR1 or 
TLR2. Strategies to deplete these pathogenic intra-articular cell subpopulations 
could be a therapeutic option for human osteoarthritis.

Background and objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory 
disease of the central nervous system, leading to demyelination of neurons and 
potentially debilitating physical and mental symptoms. The disease is more 
prevalent in women than in men. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
region has been identified as a major genetic determinant for autoimmune 
diseases, and its role in some neurological disorders including MS was 
evaluated. An intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9275596, 
located between the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 genes, is in significant association 
with various autoimmune diseases according to genome-wide association studies 
(GWASs). A cumulative effect of this SNP with other polymorphisms from this 
region was revealed. The aim of the study was to verify the data on rs9275596 
association in multiple sclerosis in a case/control study of the Latvian 
population and to evaluate eventual functional significance of allele 
substitutions. Materials and Methods: rs9275596 (chr6:32713854; GRCh38.p12) was 
genotyped in 273 MS patients and 208 controls on main and sex-specific 
associations. Eventual functional significance of allele substitutions was 
evaluated in silico using publicly available tools. Results: The rs9275596 rare 
alleles were identified as a disease susceptibility factor in association with 
the MS main group and in affected females (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, 
respectively). Risk factor genotypes with rare alleles included were associated 
with the MS common cohort (p < 0.002) and female cohort (odds ratio, OR = 2.24) 
and were identified as disease susceptible in males (OR = 2.41). It was shown 
that structural changes of rs9275596 affect the secondary structure of DNA. 
Functional significance of allele substitutions was evaluated on the eventual 
sequence affinity to transcription factors (TFs) and splicing signals 
similarity. A possible impact of the particular polymorphisms on the 
transcription and splicing efficiency is discussed. Conclusions: Our results 
suggest susceptibility of rs9275596 to multiple sclerosis in Latvians.

To evaluate the HLA typing performance of a new Long-Range PCR NGS set of 
reagents and its dedicated software, a panel of 41 reference homozygous cell 
lines from the International Histocompatibility Working Group (IHWG) and a panel 
of 376 volunteer bone marrow donors were analyzed for classical and 
non-classical HLA class I and class II genes. All results, except HLA-DPB1, were 
obtained without any ambiguities at the 3rd field level. Based on the high 
resolution performance of the reagents, a number of new alleles have been 
described not only for classical but also for non-classical HLA class I genes, 
leading to a more accurate haplotype definition. Linkage disequilibrium between 
HLA-A and HLA-G genes has been defined at 4th field level of resolution. 
Moreover, for the first time, HLA-DQA2 and DQB2 polymorphisms and their linkage 
disequilibrium with DQB1 were described.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complicated and polygenic inheritance disease, and its 
prevalence increases worldwide. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
identified a significant association of single nucleotide polymorphism with 
asthma in the Japanese population. This study aimed to examine the association 
of GWAS-supported noncoding area loci, namely rs404860, rs3117098, and 
rs7775228, with asthma in Chinese Zhuang population.
METHODS: A case-control study involving 223 individuals, comprising 123 patients 
with asthma and 100 healthy controls, was conducted. Genotypes were determined 
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ligase detection reaction assay. The 
association between gene polymorphisms and asthma risk was calculated by 
logistic regression analysis using different genetic models through comparisons 
of alleles (A vs a), homozygote genotypes (AA vs aa), heterozygote genotypes (Aa 
vs aa), dominant models (AA+Aa vs aa), and recessive models (AA vs. Aa+aa).
RESULTS: The distribution of the genotype frequency of rs3117098 was 
statistically different between the case and control groups. For rs3117098, 
significant associations were observed through comparisons of alleles (OR: 
1.832, 95% CI: 1.048-3.204, P = .034) and dominant models (OR: 2.065, 95% CI: 
1.001-4.260, P = .050). The statistical analysis showed no significant 
difference for loci rs404860 and rs7775228 between patients with asthma and 
controls.
CONCLUSION: rs3117098 may be the risk factor for asthma in Chinese Zhuang 
population.

susceptibility. We performed a secondary analysis of the results of two 
genome-wide studies for pneumonia in 23andMe participants (40 600 cases/90 039 
controls) (Tian et al., 2017) and UK Biobank (BB) participants (12 614 
cases/324 585 controls) (via the Global Biobank Engine) and used the GTEx 
database to correlate the results with expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTLs) data in lung and whole blood. In the 23andMe pneumonia single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) set, 177 genotyped SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
region satisfied the genome-wide significance level, P ≤ 5·0E-08. Several target 
genes (e.g. C4A, VARS2, SFTA2, HLA-C, HLA-DQA2) were unidirectionally regulated 
by many HLA eSNPs associated with a higher risk of pneumonia. In lung, C4A 
transcript was up-regulated by 291 pneumonia risk alleles spanning the half the 
HLA region. Among SNPs correlated with the expression levels of SFTA2 and VARS2, 
approximately 75% overlapped: all risk alleles were associated with VARS2 
up-regulation and SFTA2 down-regulation. To find shared gene loci between 
pneumonia and pulmonary function (PF), we used data from the Global Biobank 
Engine and literature on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PF in general 
populations. Numerous gene loci overlapped between pneumonia and PF: 28·8% in 
the BB data set and 49·2% in the 23andMe data set. Enrichment analysis within 
the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and National Human Genome 
Research Institute-European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI-EBI) Catalog of 
pneumonia and pneumonia/PF gene sets identified significant overlap between 
these gene sets and genes related to inflammatory, developmental, 
neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular and obesity-related traits.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with neuronal inclusions of the TAR 
DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP) represents the most common pathological 
subtype of FTLD. We established the international FTLD-TDP whole-genome 
sequencing consortium to thoroughly characterize the known genetic causes of 
FTLD-TDP and identify novel genetic risk factors. Through the study of 1131 
unrelated Caucasian patients, we estimated that C9orf72 repeat expansions and 
GRN loss-of-function mutations account for 25.5% and 13.9% of FTLD-TDP patients, 
respectively. Mutations in TBK1 (1.5%) and other known FTLD genes (1.4%) were 
rare, and the disease in 57.7% of FTLD-TDP patients was unexplained by the known 
FTLD genes. To unravel the contribution of common genetic factors to the 
FTLD-TDP etiology in these patients, we conducted a two-stage association study 
comprising the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 517 FTLD-TDP 
patients and 838 controls, followed by targeted genotyping of the most 
associated genomic loci in 119 additional FTLD-TDP patients and 1653 controls. 
We identified three genome-wide significant FTLD-TDP risk loci: one new locus at 
chromosome 7q36 within the DPP6 gene led by rs118113626 (p value = 4.82e - 08, 
OR = 2.12), and two known loci: UNC13A, led by rs1297319 (p value = 1.27e - 08, 
OR = 1.50) and HLA-DQA2 led by rs17219281 (p value = 3.22e - 08, OR = 1.98). 
While HLA represents a locus previously implicated in clinical FTLD and related 
neurodegenerative disorders, the association signal in our study is independent 
from previously reported associations. Through inspection of our whole-genome 
sequence data for genes with an excess of rare loss-of-function variants in 
FTLD-TDP patients (n ≥ 3) as compared to controls (n = 0), we further discovered 
a possible role for genes functioning within the TBK1-related immune pathway 
(e.g., DHX58, TRIM21, IRF7) in the genetic etiology of FTLD-TDP. Together, our 
study based on the largest cohort of unrelated FTLD-TDP patients assembled to 
date provides a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of FTLD-TDP, 
nominates novel FTLD-TDP risk loci, and strongly implicates the immune pathway 
in FTLD-TDP pathogenesis.

PURPOSE: Maternal type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) increases the risk of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, but the corresponding mechanism is unclear. This study aims 
to investigate the mechanism underlying the adverse pregnancy outcomes of 
maternal T1DM.
METHODS: Gene expression microarray (GSE51546) was down-loaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus. This dataset included 12 umbilical cord samples from the 
newborns of T1DM mothers (T1DM group, N = six) and non-diabetic mothers (control 
group, N = six).
RESULTS: Consequently, 1051 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found 
between the two groups. The up-regulated DEGs enriched in 30 KEGG pathways. 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRA enriched in "Type I 
diabetes mellitus". This pathway was strongly related to 14 pathways, most of 
which were associated with diseases. Then, a protein-protein interaction network 
was constructed, and 45 potential key DEGs were identified. The 45 DEGs enriched 
in pathways such as "Rheumatoid arthritis", "Chemokine signaling pathway" and 
"Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" (e.g. CXCL12 and CCL5). Transcription 
factors (TFs) of key DEGs were predicted, and a TF-DEG regulatory network was 
constructed.
CONCLUSIONS: Some genes (e.g. CXCL12 and CCL5) and their TFs were significantly 
and abnormally regulated in the umbilical cord tissue from the pregnancies of 
T1DM mothers compared to that from non-T1DM mothers.

OBJETIVE: Systemic vasculitides represent a heterogeneous group of rare complex 
diseases of the blood vessels with a poorly understood aetiology. To investigate 
the shared genetic component underlying their predisposition, we performed the 
first cross-phenotype meta-analysis of genetic data from different clinically 
distinct patterns of vasculitis.
METHODS: Immunochip genotyping data from 2465 patients diagnosed with giant cell 
arteritis, Takayasu's arteritis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated 
vasculitis or IgA vasculitis as well as 4632 unaffected controls were analysed 
to identify common susceptibility loci for vasculitis development. The possible 
functional consequences of the associated variants were interrogated using 
publicly available annotation data.
RESULTS: The strongest association signal corresponded with an intergenic 
polymorphism located between HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 (rs6932517, P=4.16E-14, 
OR=0.74). This single nucleotide polymorphism is in moderate linkage 
disequilibrium with the disease-specific human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II 
associations of each type of vasculitis and could mark them. Outside the HLA 
region, we identified the KDM4C gene as a common risk locus for vasculitides 
(highest peak rs16925200, P=6.23E-07, OR=1.75). This gene encodes a histone 
demethylase involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Through a combined analysis of Immunochip data, we have identified 
KDM4C as a new risk gene shared between systemic vasculitides, consistent with 
the increasing evidences of the crucial role that the epigenetic mechanisms have 
in the development of complex immune-mediated conditions.

Food allergy is an increasingly important health problem in the world. Several 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on European ancestry samples have 
identified food allergy-specific loci in the HLA class II region. We conducted 
GWAS of self-reported reactivity with common foods using the data from 11011 
Japanese women and identified shrimp and peach allergy-specific loci in the 
HLA-DR/DQ gene region tagged by rs74995702 (P = 6.30 × 10-17, OR = 1.91) and 
rs28359884 (P = 2.3 × 10-12, OR = 1.80), respectively. After HLA imputation 
using a Japanese population-specific reference, the most strongly associated 
haplotype was HLA-DRB1*04:05-HLA-DQB1*04:01 for shrimp allergy 
(P = 3.92 × 10-19, OR = 1.99) and HLA-DRB1*09:01-HLA-DQB1*03:03 for peach 
allergy (P = 1.15 × 10-7, OR = 1.68). Additionally, both allergies' associated 
variants were eQTLs for several HLA genes, with HLA-DQA2 the single eQTL gene 
shared between the two traits. Our study suggests that allergy to certain foods 
may be related to genetic differences that tag both HLA alleles having 
particular epitope binding specificities as well as variants modulating 
expression of particular HLA genes. Investigating this further could increase 
our understanding of food allergy aetiology and potentially lead to better 
therapeutic strategies for allergen immunotherapies.

Enterotoxaemia (ET) is a fatal enteric disease of small ruminants attributable 
to a toxigenic type of Clostridium perfringens. The key strategy for prevention 
of ET is the management and vaccination. Present study aimed at identifying the 
sources of variation for ET vaccine response especially against epsilon toxin in 
173 sheep that included 83 Avikalin and 90 Malpura lambs raised at the institute 
flock in the semi-arid region of India. The mean age at vaccination was 90 days. 
Sera were tested by blocking ELISA. Study showed significant variability for 
response to ET vaccine. 5.2% animals had + positivity, 20.8% animals had ++ 
positivity, 51.4% animals had +++ positivity and 22.5% animals had ++++ 
positivity. Amongst environmental determinants, breed, season, sex and age at 
vaccination proved to be non-significant sources of variation (P > 0.05). MHC 
genotypes with DRB1 gene and DQA2 genes also revealed non-significant 
association with ET vaccine response; however, a trend of decreasing PI values 
with increasing ranks was observed. Study revealed strong response of epsilon 
toxin along with complexity of the ET vaccine response as phenotype to be 
explained by genetic and non-genetic factors. The importance of better 
management practices and vaccination is suggested for preventive measures.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex autoimmune disorder. So far, 
genetic research in pSS has lagged far behind and the underlying biological 
mechanism is unclear. Further exploring existing genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) data is urgently expected to uncover disease-related gene combination 
patterns. Herein, we conducted a network-based analysis by integrating pSS GWAS 
in Han Chinese with a protein-protein interactions network to identify pSS 
candidate genes. After module detection and evaluation, 8 dense modules covering 
40 genes were obtained for further functional annotation. Additional 31 MHC 
genes with significant gene-level P-values (sigMHC-gene) were also remained. The 
combined module genes and sigMHC-genes, a total of 71 genes, were denoted as pSS 
candidate genes. Of these pSS candidates, 14 genes had been reported to be 
associated with any of pSS, RA, and SLE, including STAT4, GTF2I, HLA-DPB1, 
HLA-DRB1, PTTG1, HLA-DQB1, MBL2, TAP2, CFLAR, NFKBIE, HLA-DRA, APOM, HLA-DQA2 
and NOTCH4. This is the first report of the network-assisted analysis for pSS 
GWAS data to explore combined gene patterns associated with pSS. Our study 
suggests that network-assisted analysis is a useful approach to gaining further 
insights into the biology of associated genes and providing important clues for 
future research into pSS etiology.

Multiple risk variants of schizophrenia have been identified by Genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS). As a complement for GWAS, previous pathway-based 
analysis has indicated that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway might be 
involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, less replication studies 
have been reported. Our objective was to investigate the association between 
CAMs pathway and schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. We first performed 
a pathway analysis utilizing our previous GWAS data. The CAMs pathway (hsa04514) 
was significantly associated with schizophrenia using hybrid gene set-based test 
(P = 1.03×10-10) and hypergeometric test (P = 5.04×10-6). Moreover, 12 genes 
(HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-DOB, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRB1, MPZ, CD276, NLGN1, NRCAM, 
CLDN1 and ICAM3) were modestly significantly associated with schizophrenia 
(P<0.01). Then, we selected one promising gene neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) to further 
investigate the association between eight significant SNPs and schizophrenia in 
an independent sample (1814 schizophrenia cases and 1487 healthy controls). Our 
study showed that seven SNPs of NLGN1 and two haplotype blocks were 
significantly associated with schizophrenia. This association was confirmed by 
the results of combined analysis. Among them, SNP rs9835385 had the most 
significant association with schizophrenia (P = 2.83×10-7). Furthermore, in 
silico analysis we demonstrated that NLGN1 is preferentially expressed in human 
brain and SNP rs1488547 was related to the expression level. We validated the 
association of CAMs pathway with schizophrenia in pathway-level and identified 
one susceptibility gene NLGN1. Further investigation of the roles of CAMs 
pathway in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
with a strong genetic component. We undertook the present work to perform the 
first genome-wide association study on individuals from the Americas who are 
enriched for Native American heritage.
METHODS: We analyzed 3,710 individuals from the US and 4 countries of Latin 
America who were diagnosed as having SLE, and healthy controls. Samples were 
genotyped with HumanOmni1 BeadChip. Data on out-of-study controls genotyped with 
HumanOmni2.5 were also included. Statistical analyses were performed using 
SNPtest and SNPGWA. Data were adjusted for genomic control and false discovery 
rate. Imputation was performed using Impute2 and, for classic HLA alleles, 
HiBag. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The IRF5-TNPO3 region showed the strongest association and largest OR 
for SLE (rs10488631: genomic control-adjusted P [Pgcadj ] = 2.61 × 10(-29), OR 
2.12 [95% CI 1.88-2.39]), followed by HLA class II on the DQA2-DQB1 loci 
(rs9275572: Pgcadj  = 1.11 × 10(-16), OR 1.62 [95% CI 1.46-1.80] and rs9271366: 
Pgcadj  = 6.46 × 10(-12), OR 2.06 [95% CI 1.71-2.50]). Other known SLE loci 
found to be associated in this population were ITGAM, STAT4, TNIP1, NCF2, and 
IRAK1. We identified a novel locus on 10q24.33 (rs4917385: Pgcadj  = 1.39 × 
10(-8)) with an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effect (Peqtl  = 8.0 
× 10(-37) at USMG5/miR1307), and several new suggestive loci. SLE risk loci 
previously identified in Europeans and Asians were corroborated. Local ancestry 
estimation showed that the HLA allele risk contribution is of European ancestral 
origin. Imputation of HLA alleles suggested that autochthonous Native American 
haplotypes provide protection against development of SLE.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that studying admixed populations provides 
new insights in the delineation of the genetic architecture that underlies 
autoimmune and complex diseases.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic basis of airflow obstruction and smoking 
behaviour is key to determining the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). We used UK Biobank data to study the genetic causes of 
smoking behaviour and lung health.
METHODS: We sampled individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank, from the 
middle and extremes of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) distribution 
among heavy smokers (mean 35 pack-years) and never smokers. We developed a 
custom array for UK Biobank to provide optimum genome-wide coverage of common 
and low-frequency variants, dense coverage of genomic regions already implicated 
in lung health and disease, and to assay rare coding variants relevant to the UK 
population. We investigated whether there were shared genetic causes between 
different phenotypes defined by extremes of FEV1. We also looked for novel 
variants associated with extremes of FEV1 and smoking behaviour and assessed 
regions of the genome that had already shown evidence for a role in lung health 
and disease. We set genome-wide significance at p<5 × 10(-8).
FINDINGS: UK Biobank participants were recruited from March 15, 2006, to July 7, 
2010. Sample selection for the UK BiLEVE study started on Nov 22, 2012, and was 
completed on Dec 20, 2012. We selected 50,008 unique samples: 10,002 individuals 
with low FEV1, 10,000 with average FEV1, and 5002 with high FEV1 from each of 
the heavy smoker and never smoker groups. We noted a substantial sharing of 
genetic causes of low FEV1 between heavy smokers and never smokers 
(p=2.29 × 10(-16)) and between individuals with and without doctor-diagnosed 
asthma (p=6.06 × 10(-11)). We discovered six novel genome-wide significant 
signals of association with extremes of FEV1, including signals at four novel 
loci (KANSL1, TSEN54, TET2, and RBM19/TBX5) and independent signals at two 
previously reported loci (NPNT and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2). These variants also 
showed association with COPD, including in individuals with no history of 
smoking. The number of copies of a 150 kb region containing the 5' end of 
KANSL1, a gene that is important for epigenetic gene regulation, was associated 
with extremes of FEV1. We also discovered five new genome-wide significant 
signals for smoking behaviour, including a variant in NCAM1 (chromosome 11) and 
a variant on chromosome 2 (between TEX41 and PABPC1P2) that has a trans effect 
on expression of NCAM1 in brain tissue.
INTERPRETATION: By sampling from the extremes of the lung function distribution 
in UK Biobank, we identified novel genetic causes of lung function and smoking 
behaviour. These results provide new insight into the specific mechanisms 
underlying airflow obstruction, COPD, and tobacco addiction, and show 
substantial shared genetic architecture underlying airflow obstruction across 
individuals, irrespective of smoking behaviour and other airway disease.

OBJECTIVE: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses for Crohn's 
disease (CD) have not fully explained the heritability of CD, suggesting that 
additional loci are yet to be found and that the known loci may contain high 
effect rare risk variants that have thus far gone undetected by GWAS. While the 
cost of deep sequencing remains too high to analyse many samples, targeted 
sequencing of pooled DNA samples allows the efficient and cost effective capture 
of all variations in a target region.
DESIGN: We performed pooled sequencing in 500 Korean CD cases and 1000 controls 
to evaluate the coding exon and 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 131 CD 
associated genes. The identified genetic variants were validated using 
genotyping in an independent set of 500 CD cases and 1000 controls.
RESULTS: Pooled sequencing identified 30 common/low single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) in 12 genes and 3 rare SNVs in 3 genes. Our results confirmed a 
significant association of CD with the following previously reported risk loci: 
rs3810936 in TNFSF15 (OR=1.83, p<2.2×10(-16)), rs76418789 in IL23R (OR=0.47, 
p=1.14×10(-8)) and rs2241880 in ATG16L1 (OR=1.30, p=5.28×10(-6)). In addition, 
novel loci were identified in TNFSF8 (rs3181374, OR=1.53, p=1.03×10(-14)), BTNL2 
(rs28362680, OR=1.47, p=9.67×10(-11)), HLA-DQA2 (rs3208181, OR=1.36, 
p=4.66×10(-6)), STAT3 (rs1053004, OR=1.29, p=2.07×10(-5)), NFKBIA (rs2273650, 
OR=0.80, p=3.93×10(-4)), NKX2-3 (rs888208, OR=0.82, p=6.37×10(-4)) and DNAH12 
(rs4462937, OR=1.13, p=3.17×10(-2)). A novel rare SNV, rs200735402 in CARD9, was 
shown to have a protective effect (OR=0.09, p=5.28×10(-5)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep resequencing of 131 CD associated genes confirmed 3 
reported risk loci and identified 8 novel risk loci for CD in Koreans, providing 
new insights into the genetic architecture of CD.

We resequenced and phased 27 kb of DNA within 580 kb of the MHC class II region 
in 158 population chromosomes, most of which were conserved extended haplotypes 
(CEHs) of European descent or contained their centromeric fragments. We 
determined the single nucleotide polymorphism and deletion-insertion 
polymorphism alleles of the dominant sequences from HLA-DQA2 to DAXX for these 
CEHs. Nine of 13 CEHs remained sufficiently intact to possess a dominant 
sequence extending at least to DAXX, 230 kb centromeric to HLA-DPB1. We 
identified the regions centromeric to HLA-DQB1 within which single instances of 
eight "common" European MHC haplotypes previously sequenced by the MHC Haplotype 
Project (MHP) were representative of those dominant CEH sequences. Only two MHP 
haplotypes had a dominant CEH sequence throughout the centromeric and extended 
class II region and one MHP haplotype did not represent a known European CEH 
anywhere in the region. We identified the centromeric recombination transition 
points of other MHP sequences from CEH representation to non-representation. 
Several CEH pairs or groups shared sequence identity in small blocks but had 
significantly different (although still conserved for each separate CEH) 
sequences in surrounding regions. These patterns partly explain strong 
calculated linkage disequilibrium over only short (tens to hundreds of 
kilobases) distances in the context of a finite number of observed 
megabase-length CEHs comprising half a population's haplotypes. Our results 
provide a clearer picture of European CEH class II allelic structure and 
population haplotype architecture, improved regional CEH markers, and raise 
questions concerning regional recombination hotspots.

It is common to observe the clustering of chronic hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) carriers in families. Intra-familial transmission of hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) could be the reason for the familial clustering of HBsAg carriers. 
Additionally, genetic and gender factors have been reported to be involved. We 
conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study to identify genetic 
factors associated with chronic HBV susceptibility. A total of 1,065 male 
controls and 1,623 male HBsAg carriers were included. The whole-genome 
genotyping was done on Illumina HumanHap550 beadchips in 304 healthy controls 
and HumanHap610 beadchips in 321 cases. We found that rs9277535 (HLA-DPB1, 
P = 4.87×10(-14)), rs9276370 (HLA-DQA2, P = 1.9×10(-12)), rs7756516 and 
rs7453920 (HLA-DQB2, P = 1.48×10(-11) and P = 6.66×10(-15) respectively) were 
significantly associated with persistent HBV infection. A novel SNP rs9366816 
near HLA-DPA3 also showed significant association (P = 2.58×10(-10)). The 
"T-T-G-G-T" haplotype of the five SNPs further signified their association with 
the disease (P = 1.48×10(-12); OR = 1.49). The "T-T" haplotype composed of 
rs7756516 and rs9276370 was more prevalent in severe disease subgroups and 
associated with non-sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0262). The "G-C" 
haplotype was associated with sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0132; 
OR = 2.49). We confirmed that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 loci were 
associated with persistent HBV infection in male Taiwan Han-Chinese. In 
addition, the HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 complex was associated with clinical 
progression and therapeutic response.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) located across the major histocompatibility complex and 
susceptibility to diisocyanate-induced asthma (DA).
METHODS: The study population consisted of 140 diisocyanate-exposed workers. 
Genotyping was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate major histocompatibility 
complex panels.
RESULTS: The HLA-E rs1573294 and HLA-DPB1 rs928976 SNPs were associated with an 
increased risk of DA under dominant (odds ratio [OR], 6.27; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 2.37 to 16.6; OR, 2.79, 95% CI, 0.99 to 7.81, respectively) and 
recessive genetic models (OR, 6.27, 95% CI, 1.63 to 24.13; OR, 10.10, 95% CI, 
3.16 to 32.33, respectively). The HLA-B rs1811197, HLA-DOA rs3128935, and 
HLA-DQA2 rs7773955 SNPs conferred an increased risk of DA in a dominant model 
(OR, 7.64, 95% CI, 2.25 to 26.00; OR, 19.69, 95% CI, 2.89 to 135.25; OR, 8.43, 
95% CI, 3.03 to 23.48, respectively).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that genetic variations within HLA genes play 
a role in DA risk.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) related to acute lung injury (ALI) induced by sepsis with DNA 
microarray.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profile GSE10474 was downloaded from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database which includes 34 samples, among which 13 
patients with ALI + sepsis and 21 patients with sepsis alone. The DEGs were 
identified between ALI + sepsis and sepsis alone samples using R, which were 
further analyzed using bioinformatics methods. Firstly, HitPredict was used to 
search protein-protein interactions of the DEGs. Secondly, WebGestalt was 
adopted for functional enrichment analysis of genes in the interaction networks. 
Finally, DNA methylation was analyzed to explain the differential expression.
RESULTS: A total of 12 genes were identified as DEGs by comparing chip data from 
ALI + sepsis samples and those from sepsis alone samples, among which occludin 
(OCLN) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1 (HLA-DQB1) had 
21 and 6 interactors, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 
several significantly over-represented terms: cellular component organization, 
macromolecular organization and biosynthesis, and response to stimulus. In 
addition, methylation was found in the promoters of OCLN and HLA-DQB1.
CONCLUSIONS: We screened DEGs in septic ALI samples, and several interesting 
genes were obtained, especially OCLN and HLA-DQB1. They may be developed into 
marker genes for diagnosis or treatment of ALI.

Comment in
    On Lung Function and Interactions Using Genome-Wide Data.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic loci for 
spirometic measures of pulmonary function, forced expiratory volume in one 
second (FEV(1)), and its ratio to forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC). Given that 
cigarette smoking adversely affects pulmonary function, we conducted genome-wide 
joint meta-analyses (JMA) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 
SNP-by-smoking (ever-smoking or pack-years) associations on FEV(1) and 
FEV(1)/FVC across 19 studies (total N = 50,047). We identified three novel loci 
not previously associated with pulmonary function. SNPs in or near DNER 
(smallest P(JMA = )5.00×10(-11)), HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 (smallest 
P(JMA = )4.35×10(-9)), and KCNJ2 and SOX9 (smallest P(JMA = )1.28×10(-8)) were 
associated with FEV(1)/FVC or FEV(1) in meta-analysis models including SNP main 
effects, smoking main effects, and SNP-by-smoking (ever-smoking or pack-years) 
interaction. The HLA region has been widely implicated for autoimmune and lung 
phenotypes, unlike the other novel loci, which have not been widely implicated. 
We evaluated DNER, KCNJ2, and SOX9 and found them to be expressed in human lung 
tissue. DNER and SOX9 further showed evidence of differential expression in 
human airway epithelium in smokers compared to non-smokers. Our findings 
demonstrated that joint testing of SNP and SNP-by-environment interaction 
identified novel loci associated with complex traits that are missed when 
considering only the genetic main effects.

erythematosus susceptibility in Malays and Chinese.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens and genes have long been 
reported associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility in 
many populations. With the advance in technologies such as genome-wide 
association studies, many newly discovered SLE-associated single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported in recent years. These include 
HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1 rs9271366 and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 rs9275328. Our aim was to 
investigate these SNPs in a Malaysian SLE cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNPs rs9271366 and rs9275328 were screened across 790 
Malaysian citizens from three ethnic groups (360 patients and 430 healthy 
volunteers) by Taqman SNP genotyping assays. Allele and genotyping frequencies, 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, Fisher's exact test and odds ratio were calculated 
for each SNP and ethnic group. Linkage disequilibrium and interaction between 
the two SNPs were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The minor allele G and its homozygous genotype GG of HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1 
rs9271366 significantly increased the SLE susceptibility in Malaysian patients, 
including those of Malay and Chinese ethnicity (odds ratio (OR) > 1, p < 0.05). 
As for HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 rs9275328, the minor allele T and the heterozygous 
genotype CT conferred protective effect to SLE in Malaysians, as well as in 
Malays and Chinese, by having OR < 1 and p value <0.05. Both SNPs did not show 
associations to SLE in Indians. D' and r (2) values for the two SNPs in LD 
analysis were 0.941 and 0.065, respectively, with haplotype GC and AT being 
significantly associated with SLE (p < 5.0 × 10(-4)) after 10,000 permutations 
were performed. The MDR test clustered the genotype combinations of GG and CC, 
and AG and CC of rs9271366 and rs9275328, accordingly, as high-risk group, and 
the two SNPs interacted redundantly by removing 1.96% of the entropy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in addition to some classical HLA 
variants, rs9271366 and rs9275328 are additional polymorphisms worth considering 
in the Malaysian and possibly in a larger Asian SLE scenario.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in children and 
adults. An important genetic component to asthma susceptibility has long been 
recognized, most recently through the identification of several genes (e.g., 
ORMDL3, PDE4D, HLA-DQ, and TLE4) via genome-wide association studies.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with asthma affection status 
using genome-wide association data.
METHODS: We describe results from a genome-wide association study on asthma 
performed in 3855 subjects using a panel of 455 089 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs).
RESULT: The genome-wide association study resulted in the prioritization of 33 
variants for immediate follow-up in a multi-staged replication effort. Of these, 
a common polymorphism (rs9272346) localizing to within 1 Kb of HLA-DQA1 
(chromosome 6p21.3) was associated with asthma in adults (P-value = 2.2E-08) 
with consistent evidence in the more heterogeneous group of adults and children 
(P-value = 1.0E-04). Moreover, some genes identified in prior asthma GWAS were 
nominally associated with asthma in our populations.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings further replicate the HLA-DQ region in the 
pathogenesis of asthma. HLA-DQA1 is the fourth member of the HLA family found to 
be associated with asthma, in addition to the previously identified HLA-DRA, 
HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2.

The precise role of human epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) in immune response is 
highly controversial. While studying the gene expression profile of these cells, 
we were intrigued to identify the HLA-DQB2 gene as potentially expressed in LCs. 
Despite a strong evolutionary conservation of their sequences, the concomitant 
expression of the poorly polymorphic HLA-DQA2/HLA-DQB2 genes, paralogous to the 
HLA-DQA1/HLA-DQB1 genes, has never been detected in any cell type. We confirmed 
by RT-PCR that the HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 genes are both expressed in LCs, but not 
in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, or in blood CD1c(+) or plasmacytoid 
dendritic cells. The presence of the HLA-DQβ2 chain in LCs could be demonstrated 
by Western blotting, whereas immunofluorescence revealed its localization in 
early endosomes. As in the case of other HLA class II molecules, the HLA-DQα2 
and -DQβ2 chains formed heterodimers that had to associate with the invariant 
chain to reach endosomal compartments. HLA-DQα2/β2 heterodimers were expressed 
at the cell surface, where they could mediate staphylococcal superantigen 
stimulation of T cells. Interestingly, HLA-DQα2 and HLA-DQβ1 chains formed mixed 
heterodimers which efficiently left the endoplasmic reticulum. These 
observations strongly suggest that the poorly polymorphic HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 
genes should be considered to be of immunological importance. The HLA-DQα2/β2 
molecules could influence the complexity of the repertoire of Ags presented by 
LCs.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with genetic components of both 
immune system and the epidermis. PSOR1 locus (6q21) has been strongly associated 
with psoriasis; however, it is difficult to identify additional independent 
association due to strong linkage disequilibrium in the MHC region. We performed 
stepwise regression analyses of more than 3,000 SNPs in the MHC region genotyped 
using Human 610-Quad (Illumina) in 1,139 cases with psoriasis and 1,132 controls 
of Han Chinese population to search for additional independent association. With 
four regression models obtained, two SNPs rs9468925 in HLA-C/HLA-B and rs2858881 
in HLA-DQA2 were repeatedly selected in all models, suggesting that multiple 
loci outside PSOR1 locus were associated with psoriasis. More importantly we 
find that rs9468925 in HLA-C/HLA-B is associated with both psoriasis and 
vitiligo, providing first important evidence that two major skin diseases share 
a common genetic locus in the MHC, and a basis for elucidating the molecular 
mechanism of skin disorders.

region.

Parkinson's disease (PD) was recently found to be associated with HLA in a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS). Follow-up GWAS's replicated the PD-HLA 
association but their top hits differ. Do the different hits tag the same locus 
or is there more than one PD-associated variant within HLA? We show that the top 
GWAS hits are not correlated with each other (0.00≤r(2)≤0.15). Using our GWAS 
(2000 cases, 1986 controls) we conducted step-wise conditional analysis on 107 
SNPs with P<10(-3) for PD-association; 103 dropped-out, four remained 
significant. Each SNP, when conditioned on the other three, yielded 
P(SNP1) = 5×10(-4), P(SNP2) = 5×10(-4), P(SNP3) = 4×10(-3) and P(SNP4) = 0.025. 
The four SNPs were not correlated (0.01≤r(2)≤0.20). Haplotype analysis 
(excluding rare SNP2) revealed increasing PD risk with increasing risk alleles 
from OR = 1.27, P = 5×10(-3) for one risk allele to OR = 1.65, P = 4×10(-8) for 
three. Using additional 843 cases and 856 controls we replicated the independent 
effects of SNP1 (P(conditioned-on-SNP4) = 0.04) and SNP4 
(P(conditioned-on-SNP1) = 0.04); SNP2 and SNP3 could not be replicated. In 
pooled GWAS and replication, SNP1 had OR(conditioned-on-SNP4) = 1.23, 
P(conditioned-on-SNP4) = 6×10(-7); SNP4 had OR(conditioned-on-SNP1) = 1.18, 
P(conditioned-on-SNP1) = 3×10(-3); and the haplotype with both risk alleles had 
OR = 1.48, P = 2×10(-12). Genotypic OR increased with the number of risk alleles 
an individual possessed up to OR = 1.94, P = 2×10(-11) for individuals who were 
homozygous for the risk allele at both SNP1 and SNP4. SNP1 is a variant in 
HLA-DRA and is associated with HLA-DRA, DRB5 and DQA2 gene expression. SNP4 is 
correlated (r(2) = 0.95) with variants that are associated with HLA-DQA2 
expression, and with the top HLA SNP from the IPDGC GWAS (r(2) = 0.60). Our 
findings suggest more than one PD-HLA association; either different alleles of 
the same gene, or separate loci.

BACKGROUND: Atopy and plasma IgE concentration are genetically complex traits, 
and the specific genetic risk factors that lead to IgE dysregulation and 
clinical atopy are an area of active investigation.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to ascertain the genetic risk factors that lead to IgE 
dysregulation.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 6819 
participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Seventy of the top single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected based on P values and linkage 
disequilibrium among neighboring SNPs and evaluated in a meta-analysis with 5 
independent populations from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of 
Augsburg cohort, the British 1958 Birth Cohort, and the Childhood Asthma 
Management Program cohort.
RESULTS: Thirteen SNPs located in the region of 3 genes, FCER1A, signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), and IL13, were found to 
have genome-wide significance in the FHS cohort GWAS. The most significant SNPs 
from the 3 regions were rs2251746 (FCER1A, P = 2.11 × 10(-12)), rs1059513 
(STAT6, P = 2.87 × 10(-8)), and rs1295686 (IL13, P = 3.55 × 10(-8)). Four 
additional gene regions, HLA-G, HLA-DQA2, HLA-A, and Duffy blood group, 
chemokine receptor (DARC), reached genome-wide statistical significance in a 
meta-analysis combining the FHS and replication cohorts, although the DARC 
association did not appear independent of SNPs in the nearby FCER1A gene.
CONCLUSION: This GWAS of the FHS cohort has identified genetic loci in HLA genes 
that might have a role in the pathogenesis of IgE dysregulation and atopy. It 
also confirmed the association of the known susceptibility loci FCER1A, STAT6, 
and IL13 for the dysregulation of total IgE.

The selection of sheep that are resistant to gastrointestinal parasites and have 
lower faecal egg counts (FECs) has been the subject of extensive research. This 
has led to the speculation that the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes 
could be used as markers to reduce FEC. In this study, associations between 
variation in ovine MHC-DQA2 and various measures of FEC recorded at two times 
(approximately 4 and 9 months of age) were investigated in a large group of New 
Zealand lambs (n=4676), derived from 185 different sire-lines, of a variety of 
breeds and raised on 25 separate farms. Pair-sample t-tests revealed that FEC 
for Nematodirus spp., Strongyle spp. and total FEC differed significantly 
between the two assessments. A total of twenty one DQA2 alleles or 
DQA2-DQA2-like haplotypes were identified, with allele/haplotype presence and 
frequency varying significantly between farms. For example, allele *0103 was 
observed on all farms, ranging in frequency from 0.2 to 60.9%, while haplotype 
*0101-*1601 was only present on one farm, in two lambs. A number of associations 
between the presence/absence of these alleles and egg counts were observed, but 
nearly all the allelic/haplotypic associations were age and parasite specific, 
suggesting that immune response is both age and challenge (parasite species mix) 
dependent. The exception was allele *1201 which was associated with increased 
total FECs at both 4 and 9 months of age; with it either being, or tending 
toward being, significantly associated with both increased Strongyle spp. and 
Nematodirus spp. counts as well. However, the observed increases in egg counts 
were small and ranged between 5 and 32 eggs per gram. In conclusion, we believe 
that the MHC plays an important role in parasite resistance, but that the 
MHC-nematode interaction is complex and thus the development of a single 
gene-marker based on the "MHC effect" is unlikely.

BACKGROUND: Feral sheep are considered to be a source of genetic variation that 
has been lost from their domestic counterparts through selection.
METHODS: This study investigates variation in the genes KRTAP1-1, KRT33, ADRB3 
and DQA2 in Merino-like feral sheep populations from New Zealand and its 
offshore islands. These genes have previously been shown to influence wool, lamb 
survival and animal health.
RESULTS: All the genes were polymorphic, but no new allele was identified in the 
feral populations. In some of these populations, allele frequencies differed 
from those observed in commercial Merino sheep and other breeds found in New 
Zealand. Heterozygosity levels were comparable to those observed in other 
studies on feral sheep. Our results suggest that some of the feral populations 
may have been either inbred or outbred over the duration of their apparent 
isolation.
CONCLUSION: The variation described here allows us to draw some conclusions 
about the likely genetic origin of the populations and selective pressures that 
may have acted upon them, but they do not appear to be a source of new genetic 
material, at least for these four genes.

Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder with the strongest human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) association ever reported. Since the associated HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 
haplotype is common in the general population (15-25%), it has been suggested 
that it is almost necessary but not sufficient for developing narcolepsy. To 
further define the genetic basis of narcolepsy risk, we performed a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) in 562 European individuals with narcolepsy (cases) and 
702 ethnically matched controls, with independent replication in 370 cases and 
495 controls, all heterozygous for DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602. We found association 
with a protective variant near HLA-DQA2 (rs2858884; P < 3 x 10(-8)). Further 
analysis revealed that rs2858884 is strongly linked to DRB1*03-DQB1*02 (P < 4 x 
10(-43)) and DRB1*1301-DQB1*0603 (P < 3 x 10(-7)). Cases almost never carried a 
trans DRB1*1301-DQB1*0603 haplotype (odds ratio = 0.02; P < 6 x 10(-14)). This 
unexpected protective HLA haplotype suggests a virtually causal involvement of 
the HLA region in narcolepsy susceptibility.

studies in multiple sclerosis on gene expression.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological disorder. Its 
aetiology involves both environmental and genetic factors. Recent genome-wide 
association studies have identified a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) associated with susceptibility to (MS). We investigated whether these 
genetic variations were associated with alteration in gene expression.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a database of mRNA expression and genetic 
variation derived from immortalised peripheral lymphocytes to investigate 
polymorphisms associated with MS for correlation with gene expression. Several 
SNPs were found to be associated with changes in expression: in particular two 
with HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5, one with 
ZFP57, one with CD58, two with IL7 and FAM164A, and one with FAM119B, TSFM and 
KUB3. We found minimal cross-over with a recent whole genome expression study in 
MS patients.
DISCUSSION: We have shown that many susceptibility loci in MS are associated 
with changes in gene expression using an unbiased expression database. Several 
of these findings suggest novel gene candidates underlying the effects of 
MS-associated genetic variation.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that is caused by the interaction 
of genetic susceptibility with environmental influences. Genome-wide association 
studies (GWASs) represent a powerful approach to investigate the association of 
DNA variants with disease susceptibility. To date, few GWASs for asthma have 
been reported.
OBJECTIVES: A GWAS was performed on a population of patients with severe or 
difficult-to-treat asthma to identify genes that are involved in the 
pathogenesis of asthma.
METHODS: A total of 292,443 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested 
for association with asthma in 473 The Epidemiology and Natural History of 
Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) cases and 1892 Illumina general 
population controls. Asthma-related quantitative traits (total serum IgE, 
FEV(1), forced vital capacity, and FEV(1)/forced vital capacity) were also 
tested in identified candidate regions in 473 TENOR cases and 363 phenotyped 
controls without a history of asthma to analyze GWAS results further. Imputation 
was performed in identified candidate regions for analysis with denser SNP 
coverage.
RESULTS: Multiple SNPs in the RAD50-IL13 region on chromosome 5q31.1 were 
associated with asthma: rs2244012 in intron 2 of RAD50 (P = 3.04E-07). The 
HLA-DR/DQ region on chromosome 6p21.3 was also associated with asthma: rs1063355 
in the 3' untranslated region of HLA-DQB1 (P = 9.55E-06). Imputation identified 
several significant SNPs in the T(H)2 locus control region 3' of RAD50. 
Imputation also identified a more significant SNP, rs3998159 (P = 1.45E-06), 
between HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2.
CONCLUSION: This GWAS confirmed the important role of T(H)2 cytokine and antigen 
presentation genes in asthma at a genome-wide level and the importance of 
additional investigation of these 2 regions to delineate their structural 
complexity and biologic function in the development of asthma.

Determining the genomic organization of the Ovis aries (Ovar) major 
histocompatibility complex class IIa region is essential for future functional 
studies related to antigen presentation. In this study, a bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) library of genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) 
of a Rambouillet ram was constructed, and BAC clone consisting of the major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DQB2, DQA2, DQB1, DQA1, and DRB1 loci 
was identified and completely sequenced. The BAC clone consists of 160,889 bp of 
finished sequence with the loci arranged in the following order: DQB2, DQA2, 
DQB1, DQA1, and DRB1 with 14.3, 25, 6.6, and 40.9 Kb spanning between the loci, 
respectively. All five of these loci were transcribed in the animal used to 
generate the MHC class II BAC clone. Repeat or retrotransposable elements along 
with MHC class II cis promoter elements consisting of S, X, and Y boxes were 
identified in the sequence. In addition, 16 non-coding conserved sequences 
amongst primates, carnivores, and ruminants were identified (p < 0.001). These 
conserved sequences include binding sites for transcription factors with known 
roles in immune cells, and they provide a basis for further functional 
investigation of the genes in this region. This is the first ruminant finished 
sequence of the DQB2-DRB1 region, and this sequence information will aid in 
whole genome and transcriptome analyses of MHC class II.

The MHC type 1 diabetes susceptibility gene is centromeric to HLA-DQB1.

HLA-DQB1 is widely considered to be the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
susceptibility gene for type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, since inheritance of the 
gene in T1D is recessive, the presence of the protective HLA-DQB1 0602 allele 
with normal nucleotide sequence in some patients raises the question of whether 
HLA-DQB1 is not the susceptibility locus itself but merely a good marker. 
HLA-DQB1 0602 is part of a conserved extended haplotype (CEH) [HLA-B7, SC31, 
DR2] (B7, DR2) with fixed DNA over more than 1Mb of genomic DNA that normally 
carries a protective allele at the true susceptibility locus. We postulated 
that, in patients with HLA-DQB1 0602, the protective allele at the 
susceptibility locus has been replaced by a susceptibility allele through an 
ancient crossover at meiosis centromeric to HLA-DQB1. We analyzed single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distinguishing the HLA-DQA2 (the first expressed 
gene centromeric to HLA-DQB1) allele on the normal HLA-B7, DR2 CEH from those on 
susceptibility CEHs in T1D patients and controls with HLA-DQB1 0602. All but 1 
of 20 healthy control HLA-DQB1 0602 haplotypes had identical (consensus) first 
intron HLA-DQA2 5-SNP haplotypes. Fifteen of 19 patients with HLA-DQB1 0602 were 
homozygous for 1 or more HLA-DQA2 SNPs differing from consensus HLA-DQA2 SNPs, 
providing evidence of crossover involving the HLA-DQA2 locus. The remaining 4 
patients were heterozygous at all positions and therefore uninformative. The 
loss of dominant protection usually associated with HLA-DQB1 0602 haplotypes is 
consistent with a locus centromeric to HLA-DQB1 being a major determinant of 
MHC-associated susceptibility, and perhaps the true T1D susceptibility locus.

Gene expression profiling of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) 
joint tissue samples provides a unique insight into the gene signatures involved 
in disease development and progression. Fibroblast-like synovial (FLS) cells 
were obtained from RA, OA and control trauma joint tissues (non-RA, non-OA) and 
RNA was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray. Thirty-four genes specific to RA and 
OA FLS cells were identified (P<0.05). HOXD10, HOXD11, HOXD13, CCL8 and LIM 
homeobox 2 were highly and exclusively expressed in RA and CLU, 
sarcoglycan-gamma, GPR64, POU3F3, peroxisome proliferative activated 
receptor-gamma and tripartite motif-containing 2 were expressed only in OA. The 
data also revealed expression heterogeneity for patients with the same disease. 
To address disease heterogeneity in RA FLS cells, we examined the effects of 
clinical disease parameters (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, 
C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid 
factor (RF)) and drug therapies (methotrexate/prednisone) on RA FLS cell gene 
expression. Eight specific and unique correlations were identified: human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQA2 with HAQ score; Clec12A with RF; MAB21L2, SIAT7E, 
HAPLN1 and BAIAP2L1 with CRP level; RGMB and OSAP with ESR. Signature RA FLS 
cell gene expression profiles may provide insights into disease pathogenesis and 
have utility in diagnosis, prognosis and drug responsiveness.

In order to achieve high-resolution HLA-DQA1 genotyping, it is necessary to 
identify polymorphisms in exons 1, 2 and 3. We present a high-resolution 
sequence-based typing (SBT) strategy for genotyping exons 1, 2 and 3 of the 
polymorphic HLA-DQA1 locus. This method is an improvement upon previously 
presented methods, because it utilizes the minimum number of SSP-PCR assays to 
obtain clear DNA sequence in both the forward and reverse directions of all 
three exons. All known HLA-DQA1 alleles are resolved with the exception of 
HLA-DQA1*010101 and HLA-DQA1*010102 for which the distinguishing polymorphism is 
located in exon 4 and does not result in an amino acid change. This method has 
enabled our laboratory to identify three new HLA-DQA1 alleles - HLA-DQA1*040102, 
HLA- DQA1*0402 and HLA-DQA1*0404 - in the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes 
(GoKinD) study population. Additionally, we present single-allele amplification 
methods, which identify the coding sequences of HLA-DQA1 exons 1, 2, 3, intron 2 
and 300 bp of the HLA-DQA1 promoter (QAP). This study, also describes the QAP 
for most of the known HLA-DQA1 alleles, three HLA-DQA2 promoter sequences and 
the intron 2 sequences for HLA-DQA1*040101, HLA-DQA1*040102, HLA-DQA1*0402 and 
HLA-DQA1*0404.

The rhesus macaque is an important preclinical model in transplantation research 
and in investigations of chronic and infectious diseases that need a 
well-characterised major histocompatibility complex (MHC-Mamu). In a large 
population of pedigreed rhesus macaques, 70 Mamu-DRB, 18 -DQA1, 24 -DQB1, and 14 
-DPB1 alleles were detected. In humans, five HLA-DRB region configurations are 
present, displaying diversity with regard to number and combinations of loci. 
The HLA-DRB1 gene of each of these configurations is highly polymorphic. For 
rhesus monkeys, at least 31 Mamu-DRB region configurations have been determined. 
In contrast to humans, most Mamu-DRB region configurations display no or only 
limited allelic polymorphism. Segregation analyses revealed 28 Mamu-DQA1/DQB1 
pairs, each pair linked to a limited number of Mamu-DRB region configurations 
and vice versa. In comparison with humans, the degree of freedom of 
recombination between Mamu-DQA1 and -DQB1 is extremely low and equivalents of 
HLA-DQA2/DQB2 are absent. The Mamu-DPA1 gene is invariant and -DPB1 manifests 
only moderate allelic variation, whereas the HLA-DPA1 gene is oligomorphic and 
HLA-DPB1 highly polymorphic. Thus, both species used different evolutionary 
strategies to create polymorphism and diversity at the MHC class II loci in 
order to cope with pathogens.

Absence of in vivo DNA-protein interactions in the DQA2 and DQB2 promoter 
regions.

The DQ subregion of the human major histocompatibility complex (HLA) contains 
two pairs of loci: the DQA1/B1 genes (hereafter called DQ1), coding for the DQ 
molecules, and the DQA2/B2 pseudogenes (hereafter called DQ2). These pseudogenes 
are highly homologous to the functional DQ1 genes and they have no apparent 
abnormal features in their sequences that could prevent their activity. Only 
recently a low expression of the DQA2 gene has been observed whereas the DQB2 
transcript was never found. The comparison between the DQ1 and DQ2 regulatory 
sequences revealed several differences in their W, X, and Y cis-acting elements. 
To examine the DNA/protein interactions in the DQ promoter regions, we performed 
in vivo footprinting experiments. Whereas the functional DQ1 loci showed a 
series of DNA-protein contact points in the X and Y boxes, the promoters of the 
DQ2 pseudogenes displayed an unoccupied phenotype. These findings suggest that 
the very low level of DQA2 expression and the apparent lack of DQB2 activity are 
caused by the reduced binding affinity of specific transcription factors.

Phylogenetics of 23 alleles at MHC DQA loci in 7 mammalian species was studied 
based on their nucleotide (NT) substitution and synonymous codon usage (SCU) 
bias. (1) It was demonstrated that the NT substitution rates are 1.0 x 10(-9) 
NT/site/yr for exon2 and 1.3 x 10(-9) NT/site/yr for exon2-4 in a large time 
scale, which is similar to other nuclear genes, while for mouse and rat the 
rates are nearly twice as high as above mentioned. (2) The DQA locus diversity 
and their interallelic diversity developed long after the radiation of mammalian 
80Mya (million years ago). The bovine counterpart, of, and with the same recent 
ancestor of ovine DQA2, remains to be discovered. HLA-DQA2 locus split from 
HLA-DQA1 ancestor at the time between 12 approximately 20 Mya while allele 
diversity of HLA-DQA1 emerged and developed from 24 Mya to less than 1 Mya. (3) 
The phylogenetic trees based on SCU divergence reflect the phylogenetics of MHC 
DQA genes quite well generally in a new respect and reveal that HLA-DQA2 has a 
distinctive SCU bias different from all other MHC DQA locianalyzed. It indicates 
that SCU statistics plays an important and unique role in phylogenetic analysis 
of orthologous genes. The method to estimate the SCU divergence and SCU 
similarity was improved in this research.

The nonpolymorphic MHC class II isotype, HLA-DQA2, is expressed on the surface 
of B lymphoblastoid cells.

Hospital, Parkville, Australia.

The more centromeric of the two human MHC class II DQA genes, DQA2, has not 
previously been shown to express a protein product. However, its high degree of 
sequence similarity to DQA1, the fact that it is highly evolutionarily 
conserved, and the recent demonstration of its transcription in some cell lines 
suggest that a DQA2 alpha-chain may be expressed. Polyclonal anti-peptide 
antisera were generated and shown to be specific for DQA2 in Western blotting of 
Triton X-114 preparations of B lymphoblastoid cell lines. DQA2 expression is 
variable, although always at least threefold less than that of DQA1, and is 
found in all haplotypes examined. Immunoprecipitations of biotin-labeled cell 
surface proteins reveal that DQA2 appears at the cell surface. In keeping with 
others' findings, no evidence for an expressed DQB2 beta-chain was found, 
prompting investigation of the means by which DQA2 gains access to the cell 
surface. Antisera specific for allotypic and isotypic MHC class II beta-chains 
were used in sequential immunoprecipitation experiments to search for a 
beta-chain partner for DQA2, and a transfectant system was established in an 
attempt to promote pairing of DQA2 with a selected DQB1 (*0501) chain. In 
neither case was DQA2 found to dimerize with an MHC class II beta-chain. Despite 
this, DQA2 is capable of forming a complex with invariant chain.

Southern hybridization analysis of the ovine major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) (MhcOvar) class II region, using sheep-specific probes for the DQA1, DQA2, 
DQB and DRA loci, has revealed extensive polymorphism. DQA1 and DQA2 had eight 
and 16 alleles respectively, DQB had six and DRA had three alleles. Little 
information was derived from the DRB locus owing to extensive 
cross-hybridization between the DRB probe and the DQB locus. Differences in 
allele frequency between breeds were revealed. At the DQA1 locus a null allele 
(DQA1-N) was observed with a frequency of between 27% and 45%, making this the 
most common DQA1 allele in all breeds examined. The frequency of DQA1-N 
homozygotes was between 11% and 18%, raising questions as to the functional 
significance of the DQA1 gene. Linkage analysis between the DQA1, DQA2, DQB and 
DRA loci did not reveal any recombination.

Immunologic aspects of scleroderma.

Many distinct areas of investigation contribute to the understanding of immune 
abnormalities in systemic sclerosis. Recent immunohistochemical studies question 
the causal relationship of increased transforming growth factor-beta expression 
to dermal fibrosis. RNA polymerase I, II, and III have been identified as 
autoantigens specific for systemic sclerosis. Anti-RNA polymerase antibodies are 
directed against both unique and shared subunits of the multiprotein complexes. 
The targeting of several subunits suggests that the entire complexes are 
processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells. Genetic studies show that 
both HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes control the antitopoisomerase response in Japanese 
patients. The null allele of the complement component C4 and HLA-DQA2 have been 
identified as two independent disease susceptibility genes.

Treatment of Graves' disease with the block-replace regimen of antithyroid 
drugs: the effect of treatment duration and immunogenetic susceptibility on 
relapse.

Antithyroid drugs are commonly used as first-line treatment for Graves' disease, 
but the optimum regimen for inducing remission remains unclear. We gave the 
block-replace regimen of carbimazole plus thyroxine to 100 patients for 6 or 12 
months, to determine whether prolonged treatment is associated with fewer 
relapses. The remission rate one year after cessation of treatment was 59% with 
the 6 month course and 65% with 12 months; this was not significantly different. 
We also analysed HLA markers identified by restriction fragment length 
polymorphisms and could not confirm the recently reported associations of 
outcome with HLA-DR4 or with an HLA-DQA2 allele. These results show that six 
months treatment with a block-replace regimen of antithyroid drugs is probably 
sufficient, in the UK, to achieve maximum remission of Graves' disease and that 
there are no HLA markers which clearly predict outcome.

Limited polymorphism of the HLA-DQA2 promoter and identification of a variant 
octamer.

Rudy G(1), Lew AM.

Previous studies have suggested that the HLA-DQA2 gene may be associated with 
IDDM. The apparently limited allelism at this locus prompted us to investigate 
whether this association might be with the level of gene expression rather than 
with specific alleles. The proximal promoter region of HLA-DQA2 was sequenced in 
three homozygous DR4;DQ8 subjects with IDDM, six homozygous DR3;DQ2 subjects 
(three healthy controls and three with IDDM), and selected DR4 and DR6 cell 
lines. This 388-bp region encompassed the known control W/Z/H/S, X, and Y boxes 
and included a previously unremarked variant octamer sequence 40 bp upstream of 
the transcription start site. Only one polymorphic site was present among these 
15 sequences, found in one DR3;DQ2 subject and a DR6;DQ6 cell line. This 
indicates that any disease association with HLA-DQA2, at least among DR3;DQ2 
individuals, cannot be accounted for solely by polymorphism of the proximal 
promoter region.

Four full-length ovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II A cDNA 
clones coding for new alleles of DRA, DQA1 and DQA2 genes were isolated from two 
ovine lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. The derived amino acid sequences of these 
clones resemble class II A molecules from other species in both size and 
structure. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, using an Ovar-DRA 
probe on DNA from Merino and Romney sheep revealed only limited polymorphism in 
contrast to the high levels of polymorphism revealed by Ovar-DQA probes. 
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences for the three ovine A genes 
with class II A genes from five other species revealed that the most variable 
region of the molecule is the signal peptide. Although virtually every amino 
acid site shows variation, within or between species, there are some blocks of 
highly conserved residues. Within gene comparisons of nucleotide differences 
reveal that the greatest number of changes is found between the alleles of 
Ovar-DQA1 and -DQA2 genes and the least between Ovar-DRA1 alleles. Phylogenetic 
analysis of class II A sequences from several species place DRA and DQA genes on 
two distinct branches, with Ovar-DRA1 and BOLA-DRA, and Ovar-DQA1 and BOLA-DQA 
being most similar on their respective branches.

Multiple sclerosis is associated with genes within or close to the HLA-DR-DQ 
subregion on a normal DR15,DQ6,Dw2 haplotype.

Hillert J(1), Olerup O.

The HLA class II haplotype DR15,DQ6,Dw2 is associated with an increased risk for 
multiple sclerosis (MS). It has previously been shown that this haplotype 
extends to the HLA-DQA2 locus but not to the HLA-DP subregion. We report the 
distribution in 148 MS patients and 158 healthy controls of Taq I restriction 
fragments of the C4, cytochrome P-21 (CYP21), and HLA-B genes. Approximately 90% 
of the DR15,DQ6,Dw2 haplotypes extend to the C4/CYP21 loci and 50% to the HLA-B 
locus, indicated by a significant association of the haplotype with restriction 
fragments of these loci. However, there was no independent association in MS 
patients with these genes. This indicates that the susceptibility to MS is coded 
for by genes within or close to the HLA-DR-DQ subregion. Furthermore, the 
delineation of the DR15,DQ6,Dw2 haplotype is very similar in MS patients and 
control subjects. This observation supports the hypothesis that "normal" genes, 
common to all carriers of the DR15,DQ6,Dw2 haplotype, confer the increased 
genetic susceptibility to MS associated with this haplotype.

Differential expression of related HLA class II DQ beta genes caused by 
nucleotide variation in transcriptional regulatory elements.

HLA class II genes comprise a large multigene family with intra- and interlocus 
variation in structure and expression. Within this family of related genes, the 
HLA-DX alpha and beta loci (HLA DQA2 and DQB2) are highly homologous to 
functional HLA-DQ loci (HLA DQA1 and DQB1) but are frequently termed pseudogenes 
because DX gene transcription has not been observed, even in cells expressing 
HLA-DQ. Analysis of upstream transcriptional regulatory elements for the DX beta 
and DQ beta genes identified a high degree of nucleotide homology, consistent 
with their derivation from a common ancestral class II gene. However, transient 
expression assays with plasmids utilizing promoter elements from the DX beta 
gene had no activity in transfected human B cells, in contrast to homologous DQ 
beta sequences. Reciprocal exchange of specific sequences from the DQ beta gene 
with those of the DX beta gene restored expression to wild-type DQ beta levels, 
as did mutagenesis of only three DX-specific nucleotides in the upstream 
regulatory region. These three nucleotides mark two binding sites for distinct 
nuclear DNA-binding proteins that differentially recognize DQ beta and DX beta 
sequences. Transcription of these genes is critically dependent on interactions 
between these two upstream regulatory region sites which distinguish DX beta 
from its closely related homologue, DQ beta.

The cryptic HLA-DQA2 ("DX alpha") gene is expressed in human B cell lines.

Although there are two gene pairs in the HLA-DQ region, DQA1/B1 and DQA2/B2, the 
latter pair have never been found to be expressed. The DQA2 and DQB2 genes 
appear to be normal at the DNA sequence level, there being no indication that 
they should be pseudogenes, and normal splicing occurs when DQA2 is included in 
a retroviral vector. The putative amino acid sequences of DQA2 and DQB2 have 
been nearly invariant, raising the questions of how these genes have been 
maintained normal-appearing and nearly monomorphic if they are not expressed 
and, if they are expressed, in what cell types are they expressed. We present 
Northern blot, nuclease protection assay, and mRNA sequence data that 
demonstrate the existence of spliced DQA2 mRNA in human B lymphoblastoid cell 
lines. In contrast, we found no evidence of DQB2 mRNA in the same cell lines, 
nor of DQA2 mRNA in the monocyte line U937 or in activated T cells.

A statistically significant association was observed between alleles of the 
HLA-DQA2 and of the DR/DQ complex in a DNA-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism study of 219 members from 21 multiplex families of patients with 
hyperthyroid Graves' disease and 773 unrelated individuals selected for 
homozygosity of the HLA-DQA2 alleles. This data provides evidence for linkage 
disequilibrium rather than for a hot spot of recombination within the HLA-DQ 
subregion.

genes.

The nucleotide sequence of all exons and introns, excluding exon 1, of the ovine 
major histocompatibility complex (MhcOvar) genes analogous to the HLA-DQA1 and 
-DQA2 genes has been determined and the gene structure found to be similar to 
that reported for other species. The predicted amino acid sequences of the 
Ovar-DQA genes have been compared with the equivalent DQA genes in man, mouse, 
rat, rabbit, and cattle and used to determine the evolutionary relationships of 
the sheep class II genes to these other species. Northern blot analysis of sheep 
mRNA using exon specific probes for each of the two Ovar-DQA genes show that 
both genes are transcribed, whereas in humans there is no evidence that HLA-DQA2 
is transcriptionally active. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) 
have been used to define a polymorphic series of alleles in both Ovar-DQA genes 
and have indicated that the number of DQA genes is not constant in sheep as it 
is in humans, but varies with the haplotype.

HLA-DQA2 (DX alpha) polymorphism and insulin dependent diabetes.

Rowe JR(1), Neme de Gimenez MH, Emler CA, Sheehy MJ.

Author information:
(1)Research Department, American Red Cross Blood Services, Madison, WI 53705.

A certain HLA-DQA2 locus TaqI fragment, DX alpha"U", has been reported to be 
associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Reports of various 
studies in this vein have ranged from stating that the association of DQA2"U" 
with IDDM exists even among subjects positive for HLA-DR3 and -DR4 to stating 
that the association of DQA2"U" with diabetes can be attributed to linkage 
disequilibrium between the DQA2"U" and some component(s) on the affected 
haplotypes. Using a synthetic 97-base probe corresponding to a portion of an 
intron of DQA2, in a Southern blot analysis of IDDM and control subjects from 
Wisconsin, we were able to confirm the association of DQA2"U" with diabetes. 
However, among DR3 subjects there was no significant association between DQA2"U" 
and diabetes (p = 0.26). Although there was a (nonsignificant) association of 
IDDM with DQA2"U" among DR4-positive subjects (p = 0.14), this can be completely 
attributed to linkage disequilibrium between DQA2"U" and DQw8. We also sequenced 
most of the second exon (corresponding to the alpha 1 domain of the DQA2 
glycoprotein) from five individuals that were homozygous for either DQA2"U" or 
DQA2"L." The only polymorphisms observed were a "silent" mutation at position 36 
and one example of a difference that would result in a change of amino acid at 
position 41.

A SINE insertion provides information on the divergence of the HLA-DQA1 and 
HLA-DQA2 genes.

Del Pozzo G(1), Guardiola J.

Author information:
(1)International Institute of Genetics and Biophysics, CNR, Napoli, Italy.

The class II region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains 
a cluster of highly polymorphic genes organized into at least three subloci (DR, 
DQ, and DP), each encoding a subset of surface antigens participating in the 
modulation of the immune response. Genetic diversity in this system is brought 
about by two major mechanisms, hypermutation and trans-species evolution. The DQ 
subregion contains a pair of closely related A genes, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQA2, 
whose phylogenetic relationship is uncertain, although their generation by 
duplication of an ancestral A gene before or after speciation can be implied. We 
report here the presence of a member of the Alu repetitive family immediately 5' 
to the HLA-DQA1 gene. The sequence of this element indicates that it may have 
integrated by transposition at the time of divergence of hominoids from Old 
World monkeys. HLA-DQA2 carries an empty integration target site in place of the 
Alu, thereby suggesting that the insertion of Alu near HLA-DQA1 was preceded by 
the separation of the two genes.

RFLP analysis of the HLA-, ChLA-, and RhLA-DQ alpha chain gene regions: 
conservation of restriction sites during evolution.

Genomic DNA samples, derived from a panel of 60 chimpanzees and 45 rhesus 
monkeys, were digested with the restriction enzymes Taq I and Bgl II and 
hybridized with an HLA-DQ alpha chain cDNA probe. The results were compared with 
the data available on a human reference panel. Use of the restriction enzyme Taq 
I and the DQ alpha chain probe allows the detection of five HLA-DQA1 and two 
HLA-DQA2 gene-associated fragments within the human population. For the ChLA and 
RhLA systems, 3 and 7 different DQA1-associated restriction patterns were 
detected, respectively, while for the chimpanzee a nonpolymorphic DQA2 (DX 
alpha) gene-associated fragment was also observed. The equivalent of the HLA- 
and ChLA-DQA2 genes appears to be absent in the rhesus monkey. The ChLA-DQA1 and 
-DQA2 gene-associated RFLP patterns are identical in man and chimpanzee, whereas 
such restriction site conservation is not seen in the rhesus monkey. The 
conclusion drawn is that the genetic organization of the HLA-DQA and ChLA-DQA 
gene regions, and possibly some of their allelic variabilities, already existed 
before man and chimpanzee separated in evolution. Moreover, the particular 
duplication which led to the generation of the HLA- and ChLA-DQA2 genes must 
have happened before speciation of members belonging to the superfamily 
Hominoidea (man, chimpanzee, etc), but probably after the separation of 
superfamily Cercopitecoidea (rhesus monkeys, baboons, etc.) from Hominoidea.
