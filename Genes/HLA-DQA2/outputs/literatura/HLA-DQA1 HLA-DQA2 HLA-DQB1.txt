N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant chemical modifications on 
RNA and can affect the occurrence and development of diseases. Some studies have 
shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated 
by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified 
the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship 
between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and 
gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 
m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed 
(P < 0.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P < 1e-04) were 
differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the 
expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals 
(HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the 
three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding 
the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as 
therapeutic target.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and 
DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained 
through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and 
Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of 
approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and 
compared with the common susceptibility genes.
RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes 
(HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more 
than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting 
three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub 
common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 
435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility 
pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps 
including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. 
Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common 
susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were 
used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for 
SS.
CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular 
bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential 
therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in many deaths 
throughout the world. It is vital to identify the novel prognostic biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets to assist with the subsequent diagnosis and treatment 
plan to mitigate the expansion of COVID-19. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 
2 (ACE2)-positive cells are hosts for COVID-19, we focussed on this cell type to 
explore the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19. In this study, we identified that 
ACE2-positive cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients 
with COVID-19 belong to bronchial epithelial cells. Comparing with patients of 
COVID-19 showing severe symptoms, the antigen processing and presentation 
pathway was increased and 12 typical genes, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB1, CD74, HLA-DRA, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, and 
HLA-DMA, particularly HLA-DPB1, were obviously up-regulated in ACE2-positive 
bronchial epithelial cells of patients with mild disease. We further discovered 
SDCBP was positively correlated with above 12 genes particularly with HLA-DPB1 
in ACE2-positive bronchial epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, 
SDCBP may increase the immune infiltration of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T 
cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells in different lung carcinoma. 
Moreover, we found the expression of SDCBP was positively correlated with the 
expression of antigen processing and presentation genes in post-mortem lung 
biopsies tissues, which is consistent with previous discoveries. These results 
suggest that SDCBP has good potential to be further developed as a novel 
diagnostic and therapeutic target in the treatment of COVID-19.

Differential methylation of immune genes has been a consistent theme observed in 
Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, whole blood, and labial 
salivary glands (LSGs). Multiple studies have found associations supporting 
genetic control of DNA methylation in SS, which in the absence of reverse 
causation, has positive implications for the potential of epigenetic therapy. 
However, a formal study of the causal relationship between genetic variation, 
DNA methylation, and disease status is lacking. We performed a causal mediation 
analysis of DNA methylation as a mediator of nearby genetic association with SS 
using LSGs and genotype data collected from 131 female members of the Sjögren's 
International Collaborative Clinical Alliance registry, comprising of 64 SS 
cases and 67 non-cases. Bumphunter was used to first identify 
differentially-methylated regions (DMRs), then the causal inference test (CIT) 
was applied to identify DMRs mediating the association of nearby methylation 
quantitative trait loci (MeQTL) with SS. Bumphunter discovered 215 DMRs, with 
the majority located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 
6p21.3. Consistent with previous findings, regions hypomethylated in SS cases 
were enriched for gene sets associated with immune processes. Using the CIT, we 
observed a total of 19 DMR-MeQTL pairs that exhibited strong evidence for a 
causal mediation relationship. Close to half of these DMRs reside in the MHC and 
their corresponding meQTLs are in the region spanning the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, 
and HLA-DQA2 loci. The risk of SS conferred by these corresponding MeQTLs in the 
MHC was further substantiated by previous genome-wide association study results, 
with modest evidence for independent effects. By validating the presence of 
causal mediation, our findings suggest both genetic and epigenetic factors 
contribute to disease susceptibility, and inform the development of targeted 
epigenetic modification as a therapeutic approach for SS.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major complication and accounts for 
high morbidity and mortality of preterm infants. The present study aimed to 
identify the key genes in the development of BPD and to provide some new 
insights into the pathogenesis of BPD. The GSE108754 dataset was downloaded from 
Gene Expression Omnibus database containing 5 samples of BPD patients and 6 of 
non-BPD infants. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BPD and 
non-BPD patients were identified by R software. The pathway and function 
enrichment analyses were performed through Database for Annotation Visualization 
and Integrated Discovery website. The protein-protein interaction network for 
DEGs was established by Cytoscape software and the most highly connected module 
was selected through MCODE plugin. Furthermore, the clinical sample verification 
among 25 BPD patients and 10 non-BPD infants was carried out in our center. 
Finally, based on the results above, the gene set enrichment analysis focusing 
on CD74 upregulated status was employed. Totally, 189 DEGs including 147 
upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes between BPD and non-BPD patients 
were screened out. The pathway and function enrichments revealed these DEGs were 
mainly enriched in asthma, intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen 
processing and presentation and immune response. Thirteen DEGs (CD74, HLA-DMA, 
HLA-DRA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DOA, HLA-DPB1, 
HLA-DQB2, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB1) were determined as hub genes. The mRNA 
expression levels of the 13 hub genes were tested by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction among our clinical samples. Eventually, CD74 was 
confirmed to be the most significant highly expressed in BPD samples (P < .001) 
and its expression level was negatively correlated with gestational age 
(r = -0.653) and birth weight (r = -0.675). The gene set enrichment analysis 
results showed the gene sets associated with lupus erythematosus, viral 
myocarditis, immune network for IgA production, graft versus host disease, cell 
adhesion molecules and so no were differentially enriched with the phenotype of 
high-expression CD74. In conclusion, CD74 may serve to predict the BPD 
development and provide a new therapeutic target for BPD.

Recurrence of primary membranous nephropathy after transplantation occurs in up 
to 44% of patients and is driven by PLA2R antibody. Here, we asked whether 
genetic determinants could improve risk prediction. First, we sequenced PLA2R1 
and HLA-D loci in 248 patients with primary membranous nephropathy and 
identified two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at risk for 
primary membranous nephropathy at each locus. These were rs9271188 (intergenic 
between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1,) and rs9275086 (intergenic between HLA-DQB1 and 
HLA-DQA2) at the HLA-D locus along with rs6726925 and rs13018963 at the PLA2R1 
locus. Then we investigated whether primary membranous nephropathy at-risk 
variants were associated with recurrence in a retrospective cohort of 105 
donor-recipient pairs and a replication cohort of 40 pairs. Seven SNPs located 
between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 in linkage disequilibrium with rs9271188, and 
three SNPs in the PLA2R1 region predicted recurrence when presented by the 
donor, but not when presented by the recipient. The two SNPs in the HLA-D region 
most strongly associated with recurrence (rs9271705 and rs9271550) were 
confirmed in the replication cohort. A genetic risk score based on the two best 
predictors at each locus (rs9271705, rs9271550, rs17830558, and rs3828323) 
identified a group of patients with high risk of recurrence. Thus, our results 
suggest that the graft contributes to recurrence of primary membranous 
nephropathy through the disease susceptibility HLA-D and PLA2R1 SNPs in an 
autoimmune milieu. Further studies are needed before implementation of genetic 
testing for these in donor selection.

erythematosus susceptibility in Malays and Chinese.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens and genes have long been 
reported associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility in 
many populations. With the advance in technologies such as genome-wide 
association studies, many newly discovered SLE-associated single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported in recent years. These include 
HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1 rs9271366 and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 rs9275328. Our aim was to 
investigate these SNPs in a Malaysian SLE cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNPs rs9271366 and rs9275328 were screened across 790 
Malaysian citizens from three ethnic groups (360 patients and 430 healthy 
volunteers) by Taqman SNP genotyping assays. Allele and genotyping frequencies, 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, Fisher's exact test and odds ratio were calculated 
for each SNP and ethnic group. Linkage disequilibrium and interaction between 
the two SNPs were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The minor allele G and its homozygous genotype GG of HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1 
rs9271366 significantly increased the SLE susceptibility in Malaysian patients, 
including those of Malay and Chinese ethnicity (odds ratio (OR) > 1, p < 0.05). 
As for HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 rs9275328, the minor allele T and the heterozygous 
genotype CT conferred protective effect to SLE in Malaysians, as well as in 
Malays and Chinese, by having OR < 1 and p value <0.05. Both SNPs did not show 
associations to SLE in Indians. D' and r (2) values for the two SNPs in LD 
analysis were 0.941 and 0.065, respectively, with haplotype GC and AT being 
significantly associated with SLE (p < 5.0 × 10(-4)) after 10,000 permutations 
were performed. The MDR test clustered the genotype combinations of GG and CC, 
and AG and CC of rs9271366 and rs9275328, accordingly, as high-risk group, and 
the two SNPs interacted redundantly by removing 1.96% of the entropy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in addition to some classical HLA 
variants, rs9271366 and rs9275328 are additional polymorphisms worth considering 
in the Malaysian and possibly in a larger Asian SLE scenario.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in children and 
adults. An important genetic component to asthma susceptibility has long been 
recognized, most recently through the identification of several genes (e.g., 
ORMDL3, PDE4D, HLA-DQ, and TLE4) via genome-wide association studies.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with asthma affection status 
using genome-wide association data.
METHODS: We describe results from a genome-wide association study on asthma 
performed in 3855 subjects using a panel of 455 089 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs).
RESULT: The genome-wide association study resulted in the prioritization of 33 
variants for immediate follow-up in a multi-staged replication effort. Of these, 
a common polymorphism (rs9272346) localizing to within 1 Kb of HLA-DQA1 
(chromosome 6p21.3) was associated with asthma in adults (P-value = 2.2E-08) 
with consistent evidence in the more heterogeneous group of adults and children 
(P-value = 1.0E-04). Moreover, some genes identified in prior asthma GWAS were 
nominally associated with asthma in our populations.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings further replicate the HLA-DQ region in the 
pathogenesis of asthma. HLA-DQA1 is the fourth member of the HLA family found to 
be associated with asthma, in addition to the previously identified HLA-DRA, 
HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2.

The precise role of human epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) in immune response is 
highly controversial. While studying the gene expression profile of these cells, 
we were intrigued to identify the HLA-DQB2 gene as potentially expressed in LCs. 
Despite a strong evolutionary conservation of their sequences, the concomitant 
expression of the poorly polymorphic HLA-DQA2/HLA-DQB2 genes, paralogous to the 
HLA-DQA1/HLA-DQB1 genes, has never been detected in any cell type. We confirmed 
by RT-PCR that the HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 genes are both expressed in LCs, but not 
in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, or in blood CD1c(+) or plasmacytoid 
dendritic cells. The presence of the HLA-DQβ2 chain in LCs could be demonstrated 
by Western blotting, whereas immunofluorescence revealed its localization in 
early endosomes. As in the case of other HLA class II molecules, the HLA-DQα2 
and -DQβ2 chains formed heterodimers that had to associate with the invariant 
chain to reach endosomal compartments. HLA-DQα2/β2 heterodimers were expressed 
at the cell surface, where they could mediate staphylococcal superantigen 
stimulation of T cells. Interestingly, HLA-DQα2 and HLA-DQβ1 chains formed mixed 
heterodimers which efficiently left the endoplasmic reticulum. These 
observations strongly suggest that the poorly polymorphic HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 
genes should be considered to be of immunological importance. The HLA-DQα2/β2 
molecules could influence the complexity of the repertoire of Ags presented by 
LCs.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological disorder. Its 
aetiology involves both environmental and genetic factors. Recent genome-wide 
association studies have identified a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) associated with susceptibility to (MS). We investigated whether these 
genetic variations were associated with alteration in gene expression.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a database of mRNA expression and genetic 
variation derived from immortalised peripheral lymphocytes to investigate 
polymorphisms associated with MS for correlation with gene expression. Several 
SNPs were found to be associated with changes in expression: in particular two 
with HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5, one with 
ZFP57, one with CD58, two with IL7 and FAM164A, and one with FAM119B, TSFM and 
KUB3. We found minimal cross-over with a recent whole genome expression study in 
MS patients.
DISCUSSION: We have shown that many susceptibility loci in MS are associated 
with changes in gene expression using an unbiased expression database. Several 
of these findings suggest novel gene candidates underlying the effects of 
MS-associated genetic variation.

regions.

The DQ subregion of the human major histocompatibility complex (HLA) contains 
two pairs of loci: the DQA1/B1 genes (hereafter called DQ1), coding for the DQ 
molecules, and the DQA2/B2 pseudogenes (hereafter called DQ2). These pseudogenes 
are highly homologous to the functional DQ1 genes and they have no apparent 
abnormal features in their sequences that could prevent their activity. Only 
recently a low expression of the DQA2 gene has been observed whereas the DQB2 
transcript was never found. The comparison between the DQ1 and DQ2 regulatory 
sequences revealed several differences in their W, X, and Y cis-acting elements. 
To examine the DNA/protein interactions in the DQ promoter regions, we performed 
in vivo footprinting experiments. Whereas the functional DQ1 loci showed a 
series of DNA-protein contact points in the X and Y boxes, the promoters of the 
DQ2 pseudogenes displayed an unoccupied phenotype. These findings suggest that 
the very low level of DQA2 expression and the apparent lack of DQB2 activity are 
caused by the reduced binding affinity of specific transcription factors.
