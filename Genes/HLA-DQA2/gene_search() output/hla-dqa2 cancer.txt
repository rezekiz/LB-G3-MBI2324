BACKGROUND: Plasma proteins are potential biomarkers for complex diseases. We 
aimed to identify plasma protein biomarkers for lung cancer.
METHODS: We investigated genetically predicted plasma levels of 1130 proteins in 
association with lung cancer risk among 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls of 
European descent. For proteins significantly associated with lung cancer risk, 
we evaluated associations of genetically predicted expression of their coding 
genes with the risk of lung cancer.
RESULTS: Nine proteins were identified with genetically predicted plasma levels 
significantly associated with overall lung cancer risk at a false discovery rate 
(FDR) of <0.05. Proteins C2, MICA, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with increased 
lung cancer risk, while proteins SFTPB, HLA-DQA2, MICB, NRP1, and GMFG were 
associated with decreased lung cancer risk. Stratified analyses by histological 
types revealed the cross-subtype consistency of these nine associations and 
identified an additional protein, ICAM5, significantly associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma risk (FDR < 0.05). Coding genes of NRP1 and ICAM5 proteins are 
located at two loci that have never been reported by previous GWAS. Genetically 
predicted blood levels of genes C2, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with lung 
cancer risk, in directions consistent with those shown in protein-level 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Identification of novel plasma protein biomarkers provided new 
insights into the biology of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the deadliest and most diagnosed type of cancer 
worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dropped 
significantly when tumor stages advanced. Patients who received surgically 
resecting at the pre-invasive stage had a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. 
However, the study on the differences in gene expression profiles and immune 
microenvironment among pre-invasive LUAD patients is still lacking.
METHODS: In this study, the gene expression profiles of three pre-invasive LUAD 
stages were compared using the RNA-sequencing data of 10 adenocarcinoma in situ 
(AIS) samples, 12 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) samples, and 10 
invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) samples.
RESULTS: The high expression levels of PTGFRN (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95% 
Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.08-1.94; log-rank P = 0.013) and SPP1 (HR = 1.44; 
95% CI: 1.07-1.93; log-rank P = 0.015) were identified to be associated with 
LUAD prognosis. Moreover, the early LUAD invasion was accompanied by the 
enhancement of antigen presentation ability, reflected by the increase of 
myeloid dendritic cells infiltration rate (Cuzick test P < 0.01) and the 
upregulation of seven important genes participating in the antigen presentation, 
including HLA-A (Cuzick test P = 0.03), MICA (Cuzick test P = 0.01), MICB 
(Cuzick test P = 0.01), HLA-DPA1 (Cuzick test P = 0.04), HLA-DQA2 (Cuzick test P 
< 0.01), HLA-DQB1 (Cuzick test P = 0.03), and HLA-DQB2 (Cuzick test P < 0.01). 
However, the tumor-killing ability of the immune system was inhibited during 
this process, as there were no rising cytotoxic T cell activity (Cuzick test P = 
0.20) and no increasing expression in genes encoding cytotoxic proteins.
CONCLUSION: In all, our research elucidated the changes in the immune 
microenvironment during early-stage LUAD evolution and may provide a theoretical 
basis for developing novel early-stage lung cancer therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 
and despite recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the 
clinical benefit remains limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further 
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the expression and function of NPM3 in the tumor 
microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
METHODS: We utilized bioinformatics tools and databases, including UALCAN, 
GEPIA2, HPA, and Sangerbox, to analyze NPM3 expression in LUAD samples and its 
association with prognosis and mutational landscape. NPM3 expression in various 
cell types was assessed at the single cell level using the TISCH database. We 
also used algorithms such as TIMER and EPIC to explore the crosstalk between 
NPM3 expression and immune features. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to 
identify potential signaling pathways of NPM3. Finally, we employed siRNA 
knockdown strategy to investigate the effect of NPM3 on LUAD cell proliferation 
and migration in vitro.
RESULTS: NPM3 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues and was strongly 
associated with poor prognosis and TP53 gene mutations. Single-cell sequencing 
analysis revealed that NPM3 was expressed in immune cells (dendritic cells and 
monocytes/macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, NPM3 expression 
was negatively associated with immune B cell and CD4 T cell infiltration, as 
well as with several immune-related genes (including CCL22, CXCR2, CX3CR1, CCR6, 
HLA-DOA, HLA-DQA2). KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that NPM3 expression was 
associated with cell cycle, CAMs, and NSCLC pathway genes. Finally, in vitro 
experiments showed that NPM3 knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and 
migration in NCI-H1299 and SPC-A1 cells, and suppressed the expression of CCNA2 
and MAD2L1.
CONCLUSION: Elevated NPM3 expression predicts poor clinical outcome and an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment in LUAD tissues. NPM3 promotes LUAD 
progression by promoting cell proliferation and migration, and targeting NPM3 
may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for LUAD.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease with a 
heterogenous clinical presentation and unpredictable response to available 
therapies. This personalized transcriptomics study sought proof-of-concept for 
single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize patient-specific immune profiles.
METHODS: Whole blood samples from six untreated children, newly diagnosed with 
JIA, and two healthy controls were cultured for 24 h with or without ex vivo TNF 
stimulation and subjected to scRNAseq to examine cellular populations and 
transcript expression in PBMCs. A novel analytical pipeline, scPool, was 
developed wherein cells are first pooled into pseudocells prior to expression 
analysis, facilitating variance partitioning of the effects of TNF stimulus, JIA 
disease status, and individual donor.
RESULTS: Seventeen robust immune cell-types were identified, the abundance of 
which was significantly affected by TNF stimulus, which resulted in notable 
elevation of memory CD8 + T-cells and NK56 cells, but down-regulation of naïve 
B-cell proportions. Memory CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells were also both reduced in the 
JIA cases relative to two controls. Significant differential expression 
responses to TNF stimulus were also characterized, with monocytes showing more 
transcriptional shifts than T-lymphocyte subsets, while the B-cell response was 
more limited. We also show that donor variability exceeds the small degree of 
possible intrinsic differentiation between JIA and control profiles. An 
incidental finding of interest was association of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRB5 
expression with JIA status.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of personalized 
immune-profiling combined with ex-vivo immune stimulation for evaluation of 
patient-specific modes of immune cell activity in autoimmune rheumatic disease.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II plays critical roles in antigen 
presentation and the initiation of immune responses. However, the correlation 
between the HLA class II gene expression level and the survival of patients with 
breast cancer is still under investigation. We analyzed microarray and RNA-Seq 
data of breast cancer from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), genotype-tissue 
expression (GTEx) and Oncomine databases by using bioinformatics tools. The 
expression of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB2 genes was significantly 
upregulated in breast cancer. Higher expression levels of HLA class II genes in 
breast cancer, especially HLA-DOB and HLA-DQB2, were significantly associated 
with better overall survival. Furthermore, the expression of HLA class II genes 
was more closely associated with survival in breast cancer than in other cancer 
types. CD48 coexpressed with both HLA-DOB and HLA-DQB2 was also positively 
associated with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. The results 
indicated that HLA class II and CD48 may enhance antitumor immunity, and their 
expression patterns may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets in breast cancer.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) is frequently mutated in glioma tissues, and 
this mutation mediates specific tumor-promoting mechanisms in glioma cells. We 
aimed to identify specific immune biomarkers for IDH1-mutation (IDH1mt) glioma. 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were used 
to obtain RNA sequencing data and clinical characteristics of glioma tissues, 
while the stromal and immune scores of TCGA glioma tissues were determined using 
the ESTIMATE algorithm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the 
protein-protein interaction(PPI) network, and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses were used to select hub 
genes associated with stroma and immune scores and the prognoses of patients and 
to construct the risk model. The practicability and specificity of the risk 
model in both IDH1mt and IDH1-wildtype (wtIDH1) gliomas in TCGA and CGGA were 
evaluated. Molecular mechanisms, immunological characteristics and benefits of 
immune checkpoint blockade therapy in glioma tissues with IDH1mt were analyzed 
using GSEA, immunohistochemical staining, CIBERSORT, and T-cell dysfunction and 
exclusion (TIDE) analysis. The overall survival rate for IDH1mt-glioma patients 
with high stroma/immune scores was lower than that for those with low 
stroma/immune scores. A total of 222 DEGs were identified in IDH1mt glioma 
tissues with high stroma/immune scores. Among them, 72 genes had interactions in 
the PPI network, while three genes, HLA-DQA2, HOXA3, and SAA2, were selected as 
hub genes and used to construct risk models classifying patients into high- and 
low-risk score groups, followed by LASSO and Cox regression analyses. This risk 
model showed prognostic value in IDH1mt glioma in both TCGA and CCGA; 
nevertheless, the model was not suitable for wtIDH1 glioma. The risk model may 
act as an independent prognostic factor for IDH1mt glioma. IDH1mt glioma tissues 
from patients with high-risk scores showed more infiltration of M1 and CD8 T 
cells than those from patients with low-risk scores. Moreover, TIDE analysis 
showed that immune checkpoint blockade(ICB) therapy was highly beneficial for 
IDH1mt patients with high-risk scores. The risk model showed specific potential 
to predict the prognosis of IDH1mt-glioma patients, as well as guide ICB, 
contributing to the diagnosis and therapy of IDH1mt-glioma patients.

INTRODUCTION: Although genome-wide association studies have been conducted to 
investigate genetic variation of lung tumorigenesis, little is known about 
gene-gene (G × G) interactions that may influence the risk of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Leveraging a total of 445,221 European-descent participants from the 
International Lung Cancer Consortium OncoArray project, Transdisciplinary 
Research in Cancer of the Lung and UK Biobank, we performed a large-scale 
genome-wide G × G interaction study on European NSCLC risk by a series of 
analyses. First, we used BiForce to evaluate and rank more than 58 billion G × G 
interactions from 340,958 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Then, the top 
interactions were further tested by demographically adjusted logistic regression 
models. Finally, we used the selected interactions to build lung cancer 
screening models of NSCLC, separately, for never and ever smokers.
RESULTS: With the Bonferroni correction, we identified eight statistically 
significant pairs of SNPs, which predominantly appeared in the 6p21.32 and 
5p15.33 regions (e.g., rs521828C6orf10 and rs204999PRRT1, ORinteraction = 1.17, 
p = 6.57 × 10-13; rs3135369BTNL2 and rs2858859HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 1.17, 
p = 2.43 × 10-13; rs2858859HLA-DQA1 and rs9275572HLA-DQA2, ORinteraction = 1.15, 
p = 2.84 × 10-13; rs2853668TERT and rs62329694CLPTM1L, ORinteraction = 0.73, p = 
2.70 × 10-13). Notably, even with much genetic heterogeneity across ethnicities, 
three pairs of SNPs in the 6p21.32 region identified from the European-ancestry 
population remained significant among an Asian population from the Nanjing 
Medical University Global Screening Array project (rs521828C6orf10 and 
rs204999PRRT1, ORinteraction = 1.13, p = 0.008; rs3135369BTNL2 and 
rs2858859HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 1.11, p = 5.23 × 10-4; rs3135369BTNL2 and 
rs9271300HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 0.89, p = 0.006). The interaction-empowered 
polygenetic risk score that integrated classical polygenetic risk score and G × 
G information score was remarkable in lung cancer risk stratification.
CONCLUSIONS: Important G × G interactions were identified and enriched in the 
5p15.33 and 6p21.32 regions, which may enhance lung cancer screening models.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to screen and validate the crucial genes involved 
in osteoarthritis (OA) and explore its potential molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Four expression profile datasets related to OA were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 4 
microarray patterns were identified by the meta-analysis method. The weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method was used to investigate 
stable modules most related to OA. In addition, a protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network was built to explore hub genes in OA. Moreover, OA-related genes 
and pathways were retrieved from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).
RESULTS: A total of 1,136 DEGs were identified from 4 datasets. Based on these 
DEGs, WGCNA further explored 370 genes included in the 3 OA-related stable 
modules. A total of 10 hub genes were identified in the PPI network, including 
AKT1, CDC42, HLA-DQA2, TUBB, TWISTNB, GSK3B, FZD2, KLC1, GUSB, and RHOG. 
Besides, 5 pathways including "Lysosome," "Pathways in cancer," "Wnt signaling 
pathway," "ECM-receptor interaction" and "Focal adhesion" in CTD and enrichment 
analysis and 5 OA-related hub genes (including GSK3B, CDC42, AKT1, FZD2, and 
GUSB) were identified.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the meta-analysis was used to screen the central 
genes associated with OA in a variety of gene expression profiles. Three 
OA-related modules (green, turquoise, and yellow) containing 370 genes were 
identified through WGCNA. It was discovered through the gene-pathway network 
that GSK3B, CDC42, AKT1, FZD2, and GUSB may be key genes related to the progress 
of OA and may become promising therapeutic targets.

Recurrence of primary membranous nephropathy after transplantation occurs in up 
to 44% of patients and is driven by PLA2R antibody. Here, we asked whether 
genetic determinants could improve risk prediction. First, we sequenced PLA2R1 
and HLA-D loci in 248 patients with primary membranous nephropathy and 
identified two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at risk for 
primary membranous nephropathy at each locus. These were rs9271188 (intergenic 
between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1,) and rs9275086 (intergenic between HLA-DQB1 and 
HLA-DQA2) at the HLA-D locus along with rs6726925 and rs13018963 at the PLA2R1 
locus. Then we investigated whether primary membranous nephropathy at-risk 
variants were associated with recurrence in a retrospective cohort of 105 
donor-recipient pairs and a replication cohort of 40 pairs. Seven SNPs located 
between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 in linkage disequilibrium with rs9271188, and 
three SNPs in the PLA2R1 region predicted recurrence when presented by the 
donor, but not when presented by the recipient. The two SNPs in the HLA-D region 
most strongly associated with recurrence (rs9271705 and rs9271550) were 
confirmed in the replication cohort. A genetic risk score based on the two best 
predictors at each locus (rs9271705, rs9271550, rs17830558, and rs3828323) 
identified a group of patients with high risk of recurrence. Thus, our results 
suggest that the graft contributes to recurrence of primary membranous 
nephropathy through the disease susceptibility HLA-D and PLA2R1 SNPs in an 
autoimmune milieu. Further studies are needed before implementation of genetic 
testing for these in donor selection.

OBJECTIVE: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses for Crohn's 
disease (CD) have not fully explained the heritability of CD, suggesting that 
additional loci are yet to be found and that the known loci may contain high 
effect rare risk variants that have thus far gone undetected by GWAS. While the 
cost of deep sequencing remains too high to analyse many samples, targeted 
sequencing of pooled DNA samples allows the efficient and cost effective capture 
of all variations in a target region.
DESIGN: We performed pooled sequencing in 500 Korean CD cases and 1000 controls 
to evaluate the coding exon and 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 131 CD 
associated genes. The identified genetic variants were validated using 
genotyping in an independent set of 500 CD cases and 1000 controls.
RESULTS: Pooled sequencing identified 30 common/low single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) in 12 genes and 3 rare SNVs in 3 genes. Our results confirmed a 
significant association of CD with the following previously reported risk loci: 
rs3810936 in TNFSF15 (OR=1.83, p<2.2×10(-16)), rs76418789 in IL23R (OR=0.47, 
p=1.14×10(-8)) and rs2241880 in ATG16L1 (OR=1.30, p=5.28×10(-6)). In addition, 
novel loci were identified in TNFSF8 (rs3181374, OR=1.53, p=1.03×10(-14)), BTNL2 
(rs28362680, OR=1.47, p=9.67×10(-11)), HLA-DQA2 (rs3208181, OR=1.36, 
p=4.66×10(-6)), STAT3 (rs1053004, OR=1.29, p=2.07×10(-5)), NFKBIA (rs2273650, 
OR=0.80, p=3.93×10(-4)), NKX2-3 (rs888208, OR=0.82, p=6.37×10(-4)) and DNAH12 
(rs4462937, OR=1.13, p=3.17×10(-2)). A novel rare SNV, rs200735402 in CARD9, was 
shown to have a protective effect (OR=0.09, p=5.28×10(-5)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep resequencing of 131 CD associated genes confirmed 3 
reported risk loci and identified 8 novel risk loci for CD in Koreans, providing 
new insights into the genetic architecture of CD.
