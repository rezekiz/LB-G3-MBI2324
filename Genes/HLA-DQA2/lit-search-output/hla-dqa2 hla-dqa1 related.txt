N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant chemical modifications on 
RNA and can affect the occurrence and development of diseases. Some studies have 
shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated 
by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified 
the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship 
between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and 
gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 
m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed 
(P < 0.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P < 1e-04) were 
differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the 
expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals 
(HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the 
three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding 
the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as 
therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: An increased risk of infection, malignancy, and cardiovascular 
diseases in maintenance hemodialysis patients is associated with 
hemodialysis-related immunity disturbances. Although defects in 
T-lymphocyte-dependent immune responses and preactivation of antigen-presenting 
cells have been documented in hemodialysis patients, the effects of long-term 
hemodialysis on the transcriptional program and chromosomal accessibility of 
circulating immune cell subpopulations remain poorly defined.
METHODS: We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to 
characterize the transcriptome profiles of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
from healthy controls and maintenance hemodialysis patients. Validation of 
differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells and monocytes were performed by 
magnetic bead separation and quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: We identified 16 and 15 PBMC subgroups in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq 
datasets, respectively. Hemodialysis significantly suppressed the expression 
levels of T cell receptor (TCR) genes in CD4+ T cell subsets (e.g., TRAV4, CD45, 
CD3G, CD3D, CD3E) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) 
pathway-related genes in monocytes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPB1). 
Downstream pathways of TCR signaling, including PI3K-Akt-mTOR, MAPK, TNF, and 
NF-κB pathways, were also inhibited in CD4+ T cell subpopulations during the 
hemodialysis procedure. Hemodialysis altered cellular communication patterns 
between PBMC subgroups, particularly TGF-TGFBR, HVEM-BTLA, and IL16-CD4 
signalings between CD4+ T cells and monocytes. Additionally, we found that 
hemodialysis inhibited the expression of AP-1 family transcription factors (JUN, 
JUND, FOS, FOSB) by interfering with the chromatin accessibility profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a valuable framework for future investigations 
of hemodialysis-related immune dysregulation and identifies potential 
therapeutic targets for reconstituting the circulating immune system in 
maintenance hemodialysis patients.

INTRODUCTION: Although genome-wide association studies have been conducted to 
investigate genetic variation of lung tumorigenesis, little is known about 
gene-gene (G × G) interactions that may influence the risk of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Leveraging a total of 445,221 European-descent participants from the 
International Lung Cancer Consortium OncoArray project, Transdisciplinary 
Research in Cancer of the Lung and UK Biobank, we performed a large-scale 
genome-wide G × G interaction study on European NSCLC risk by a series of 
analyses. First, we used BiForce to evaluate and rank more than 58 billion G × G 
interactions from 340,958 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Then, the top 
interactions were further tested by demographically adjusted logistic regression 
models. Finally, we used the selected interactions to build lung cancer 
screening models of NSCLC, separately, for never and ever smokers.
RESULTS: With the Bonferroni correction, we identified eight statistically 
significant pairs of SNPs, which predominantly appeared in the 6p21.32 and 
5p15.33 regions (e.g., rs521828C6orf10 and rs204999PRRT1, ORinteraction = 1.17, 
p = 6.57 × 10-13; rs3135369BTNL2 and rs2858859HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 1.17, 
p = 2.43 × 10-13; rs2858859HLA-DQA1 and rs9275572HLA-DQA2, ORinteraction = 1.15, 
p = 2.84 × 10-13; rs2853668TERT and rs62329694CLPTM1L, ORinteraction = 0.73, p = 
2.70 × 10-13). Notably, even with much genetic heterogeneity across ethnicities, 
three pairs of SNPs in the 6p21.32 region identified from the European-ancestry 
population remained significant among an Asian population from the Nanjing 
Medical University Global Screening Array project (rs521828C6orf10 and 
rs204999PRRT1, ORinteraction = 1.13, p = 0.008; rs3135369BTNL2 and 
rs2858859HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 1.11, p = 5.23 × 10-4; rs3135369BTNL2 and 
rs9271300HLA-DQA1, ORinteraction = 0.89, p = 0.006). The interaction-empowered 
polygenetic risk score that integrated classical polygenetic risk score and G × 
G information score was remarkable in lung cancer risk stratification.
CONCLUSIONS: Important G × G interactions were identified and enriched in the 
5p15.33 and 6p21.32 regions, which may enhance lung cancer screening models.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and 
DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained 
through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and 
Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of 
approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and 
compared with the common susceptibility genes.
RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes 
(HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more 
than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting 
three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub 
common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 
435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility 
pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps 
including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. 
Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common 
susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were 
used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for 
SS.
CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular 
bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential 
therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.

Transcriptomic profiling reveals gene expression in human peripheral blood after 
exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation.

Fang F, Yu X, Wang X, Zhu X, Liu L, Rong L, Niu D, Li J.

Although the health effects of exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation have been 
the focus of many studies, the affected biological functions and underlying 
regulatory mechanisms are not well-understood. In particular, the influence of 
radiation exposure at doses of less than 200 mGy on the regulation of genes and 
pathways remains unclear. To investigate the molecular alterations induced by 
varying doses of low-dose radiation (LDR), transcriptomic analysis was conducted 
based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing following exposure to 50 and 150 mGy 
doses. Human peripheral blood was collected, and the samples were divided into 
three groups, including two treatments and one control (no radiation). A total 
of 876 (318 upregulated and 558 downregulated) and 486 (202 upregulated and 284 
downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after 
exposure to 50 mGy and 150 mGy, respectively. Most upregulated genes in both the 
50 mGy and 150 mGy groups were associated with 'antigen processing and 
presentation,' which appeared to be the major targets affected by LDR exposure. 
Several interacting genes, including HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB1, and 
HLA-DRB5 were mapped to 'antigen processing and presentation,' 'immune 
system-related diseases' and the 'cytokine-mediated signaling pathway,' 
suggesting that these genes might drive the downstream transmission of these 
signal transduction pathways. Our results suggest that exposure to LDR may 
elicit changes in key genes and associated pathways, probably helping further 
explore the biological processes and molecular mechanism responsible for 
low-dose occupational or environmental exposures in humans.

PURPOSE: Maternal type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) increases the risk of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, but the corresponding mechanism is unclear. This study aims 
to investigate the mechanism underlying the adverse pregnancy outcomes of 
maternal T1DM.
METHODS: Gene expression microarray (GSE51546) was down-loaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus. This dataset included 12 umbilical cord samples from the 
newborns of T1DM mothers (T1DM group, N = six) and non-diabetic mothers (control 
group, N = six).
RESULTS: Consequently, 1051 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found 
between the two groups. The up-regulated DEGs enriched in 30 KEGG pathways. 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRA enriched in "Type I 
diabetes mellitus". This pathway was strongly related to 14 pathways, most of 
which were associated with diseases. Then, a protein-protein interaction network 
was constructed, and 45 potential key DEGs were identified. The 45 DEGs enriched 
in pathways such as "Rheumatoid arthritis", "Chemokine signaling pathway" and 
"Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" (e.g. CXCL12 and CCL5). Transcription 
factors (TFs) of key DEGs were predicted, and a TF-DEG regulatory network was 
constructed.
CONCLUSIONS: Some genes (e.g. CXCL12 and CCL5) and their TFs were significantly 
and abnormally regulated in the umbilical cord tissue from the pregnancies of 
T1DM mothers compared to that from non-T1DM mothers.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in children and 
adults. An important genetic component to asthma susceptibility has long been 
recognized, most recently through the identification of several genes (e.g., 
ORMDL3, PDE4D, HLA-DQ, and TLE4) via genome-wide association studies.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with asthma affection status 
using genome-wide association data.
METHODS: We describe results from a genome-wide association study on asthma 
performed in 3855 subjects using a panel of 455 089 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs).
RESULT: The genome-wide association study resulted in the prioritization of 33 
variants for immediate follow-up in a multi-staged replication effort. Of these, 
a common polymorphism (rs9272346) localizing to within 1 Kb of HLA-DQA1 
(chromosome 6p21.3) was associated with asthma in adults (P-value = 2.2E-08) 
with consistent evidence in the more heterogeneous group of adults and children 
(P-value = 1.0E-04). Moreover, some genes identified in prior asthma GWAS were 
nominally associated with asthma in our populations.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings further replicate the HLA-DQ region in the 
pathogenesis of asthma. HLA-DQA1 is the fourth member of the HLA family found to 
be associated with asthma, in addition to the previously identified HLA-DRA, 
HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2.

Differential expression of related HLA class II DQ beta genes caused by 
nucleotide variation in transcriptional regulatory elements.

Shewey LM(1), Beaty JS, Andersen LC, Nepom GT.

Author information:
(1)Virginia Mason Research Center, Seattle, WA 98101.

HLA class II genes comprise a large multigene family with intra- and interlocus 
variation in structure and expression. Within this family of related genes, the 
HLA-DX alpha and beta loci (HLA DQA2 and DQB2) are highly homologous to 
functional HLA-DQ loci (HLA DQA1 and DQB1) but are frequently termed pseudogenes 
because DX gene transcription has not been observed, even in cells expressing 
HLA-DQ. Analysis of upstream transcriptional regulatory elements for the DX beta 
and DQ beta genes identified a high degree of nucleotide homology, consistent 
with their derivation from a common ancestral class II gene. However, transient 
expression assays with plasmids utilizing promoter elements from the DX beta 
gene had no activity in transfected human B cells, in contrast to homologous DQ 
beta sequences. Reciprocal exchange of specific sequences from the DQ beta gene 
with those of the DX beta gene restored expression to wild-type DQ beta levels, 
as did mutagenesis of only three DX-specific nucleotides in the upstream 
regulatory region. These three nucleotides mark two binding sites for distinct 
nuclear DNA-binding proteins that differentially recognize DQ beta and DX beta 
sequences. Transcription of these genes is critically dependent on interactions 
between these two upstream regulatory region sites which distinguish DX beta 
from its closely related homologue, DQ beta.

The class II region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains 
a cluster of highly polymorphic genes organized into at least three subloci (DR, 
DQ, and DP), each encoding a subset of surface antigens participating in the 
modulation of the immune response. Genetic diversity in this system is brought 
about by two major mechanisms, hypermutation and trans-species evolution. The DQ 
subregion contains a pair of closely related A genes, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQA2, 
whose phylogenetic relationship is uncertain, although their generation by 
duplication of an ancestral A gene before or after speciation can be implied. We 
report here the presence of a member of the Alu repetitive family immediately 5' 
to the HLA-DQA1 gene. The sequence of this element indicates that it may have 
integrated by transposition at the time of divergence of hominoids from Old 
World monkeys. HLA-DQA2 carries an empty integration target site in place of the 
Alu, thereby suggesting that the insertion of Alu near HLA-DQA1 was preceded by 
the separation of the two genes.
