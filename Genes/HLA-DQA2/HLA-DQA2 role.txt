BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies of asthma have revealed robust 
associations with variation across the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex 
with independent associations in the HLA class I and class II regions for both 
childhood-onset asthma (COA) and adult-onset asthma (AOA). However, the specific 
variants and genes contributing to risk are unknown.
METHODS: We used Bayesian approaches to perform genetic fine-mapping for COA and 
AOA (n=9432 and 21,556, respectively; n=318,167 shared controls) in White 
British individuals from the UK Biobank and to perform expression quantitative 
trait locus (eQTL) fine-mapping in immune (lymphoblastoid cell lines, n=398; 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, n=132) and airway (nasal epithelial cells, 
n=188) cells from ethnically diverse individuals. We also examined putatively 
causal protein coding variation from protein crystal structures and conducted 
replication studies in independent multi-ethnic cohorts from the UK Biobank (COA 
n=1686; AOA n=3666; controls n=56,063).
RESULTS: Genetic fine-mapping revealed both shared and distinct causal variation 
between COA and AOA in the class I region but only distinct causal variation in 
the class II region. Both gene expression levels and amino acid variation 
contributed to risk. Our results from eQTL fine-mapping and amino acid 
visualization suggested that the HLA-DQA1*03:01 allele and variation associated 
with expression of the nonclassical HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes accounted 
entirely for the most significant association with AOA in GWAS. Our studies also 
suggested a potentially prominent role for HLA-C protein coding variation in the 
class I region in COA. We replicated putatively causal variant associations in a 
multi-ethnic cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight roles for both gene expression and protein coding 
variation in asthma risk and identified putatively causal variation and genes in 
the HLA region. A convergence of genomic, transcriptional, and protein coding 
evidence implicates the HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes and HLA-DQA1*03:01 allele in 
AOA.

Elucidating regulatory effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated genetic 
variants is critical for unraveling their causal pathways and understanding the 
pathology. However, their cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in the brain 
remain largely unclear. Here, we conducted an analysis of allele-specific 
expression quantitative trait loci (aseQTLs) for 33 AD-associated variants in 
four brain regions and seven cell types using ~3000 bulk RNA-seq samples and 
>0.25 million single nuclei. We first develop a flexible hierarchical Poisson 
mixed model (HPMM) and demonstrate its superior statistical power to a 
beta-binomial model achieved by unifying samples in both allelic and 
genotype-level expression data. Using the HPMM, we identified 24 (~73%) aseQTLs 
in at least one brain region, including three new eQTLs associated with CA12, 
CHRNE, and CASS4. Notably, the APOE ε4 variant reduces APOE expression across 
all regions, even in AD-unaffected controls. Our results reveal region-dependent 
and exon-specific effects of multiple aseQTLs, such as rs2093760 with CR1, 
rs7982 with CLU, and rs3865444 with CD33. In an attempt to pinpoint the cell 
types responsible for the observed tissue-level aseQTLs using the snRNA-seq 
data, we detected many aseQTLs in microglia or monocytes associated with 
immune-related genes, including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, CD33, FCER1G, MS4A6A, SPI1, 
and BIN1, highlighting the regulatory role of AD-associated variants in the 
immune response. These findings provide further insights into potential causal 
pathways and cell types mediating the effects of the AD-associated variants.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and 
DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained 
through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and 
Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of 
approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and 
compared with the common susceptibility genes.
RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes 
(HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more 
than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting 
three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub 
common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 
435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility 
pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps 
including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. 
Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common 
susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were 
used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for 
SS.
CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular 
bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential 
therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.

Immune system plays important roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease 
(PD). However, the role of B cells in this complex disease are still not fully 
understood. B cells produce antibodies but can also regulate immune responses. 
In order to decode the relative contribution of peripheral B cell subtypes to 
the etiology of PD, we performed single cell RNA and BCR sequencing for 10,466 B 
cells from 8 PD patients and 6 age-matched healthy controls. We observed 
significant increased memory B cells and significant decreased naïve B cells in 
PD patients compared to healthy controls. Notably, we also discovered increased 
IgG and IgA isotypes and more frequent class switch recombination events in PD 
patients. Moreover, we identified preferential V and J gene segments of B cell 
receptors in PD patients as the evidence of convergent selection in PD. Finally, 
we found a marked clonal expanded memory B cell population in PD patients, 
up-regulating both MHC II genes (HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DPB1) and 
transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1), suggesting that the antigen 
presentation capacity of B cells was enhanced and B cells were activated in PD 
patients. Overall, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of peripheral B 
cell characteristics of PD patients, which provided novel insights into the 
humoral immune response in the pathogenesis of PD.

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is classified as a sort of serious nervous 
system syndrome that occurs in the early life period. Noncoding RNAs had been 
confirmed to have crucial roles in human diseases. So far, there were few 
systematical and comprehensive studies towards the expression profile of RNAs in 
the brain after hypoxia ischemia. In this study, 31 differentially expressed 
microRNAs (miRNAs) with upregulation were identified. In addition, 5512 
differentially expressed mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) were identified in HIE groups. Bioinformatics analysis showed these 
circRNAs and mRNAs were significantly enriched in regulation of leukocyte 
activation, response to virus, and neutrophil degranulation. Pathway and its 
related gene network analysis indicated that HLA - DPA1, HLA - DQA2, HLA - DQB1, 
and HLA - DRB4 have a more crucial role in HIE. Finally, miRNA-circRNA-mRNA 
interaction network analysis was also performed to identify hub miRNAs and 
circRNAs. We found that miR-592 potentially targeting 5 circRNAs, thus affecting 
15 mRNA expressions in HIR. hsa_circ_0068397 and hsa_circ_0045698 were 
identified as hub circRNAs in HIE. Collectively, using RNA-seq, bioinformatics 
analysis, and circRNA/miRNA interaction prediction, we systematically 
investigated the differentially expressed RNAs in HIE, which could give a new 
hint of understanding the pathogenesis of HIE.

WNT signaling in neuroinflammation and in age-related impairment of striatal 
neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

BACKGROUND: Motor and cognitive decline as part of the normal aging process is 
linked to alterations in synaptic plasticity and reduction of adult neurogenesis 
in the dorsal striatum. Neuroinflammation, particularly in the form of 
microglial activation, is suggested to contribute to these age-associated 
changes.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To explore the molecular basis of alterations in striatal 
function during aging we analyzed RNA-Seq data for 117 postmortem human dorsal 
caudate samples and 97 putamen samples acquired through GTEx.
RESULTS: Increased expression of neuroinflammatory transcripts including TREM2, 
MHC II molecules HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DMA and HLA-DRA, 
complement genes C1QA, C1QB, CIQC and C3AR1, and MHCI molecules HLA-B and HLA-F 
was identified. We also identified down-regulation of transcripts involved in 
neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic pruning, including DCX, CX3CL1, and 
CD200, and the canonical WNTs WNT7A, WNT7B, and WNT8A. The canonical WNT 
signaling pathway has previously been shown to mediate adult neurogenesis and 
synapse formation and growth. Recent findings also highlight the link between 
WNT/β-catenin signaling and inflammation pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that age-dependent attenuation of canonical 
WNT signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating striatal plasticity during 
aging. Dysregulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling via astrocyte-microglial 
interactions is suggested to be a novel mechanism that drives the decline of 
striatal neurogenesis and altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity, leading 
to a subsequent decrease in motor and cognitive performance with age. These 
findings may aid in the development of therapies targeting WNT/β-catenin 
signaling to combat cognitive and motor impairments associated with aging.

Glomerulonephritis is the one of the major causes of the end-stage kidney 
disease, whereas the pathological process of glomerulonephritis is still not 
completely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) emerges to be a 
powerful tool to evaluate the full heterogeneity of kidney diseases. To reveal 
cellular gene expression profiles of glomerulonephritis, we performed scRNA-seq 
of 2 human kidney transplantation donor samples, 4 human glomerulonephritis 
samples, 1 human malignant hypertension (MH) sample and 1 human chronic 
interstitial nephritis (CIN) sample, all tissues were taken from the biopsy. 
After filtering the cells with < 200 genes and > 10% mitochondria (MT) genes, 
the resulting 14 932 cells can be divided into 20 cell clusters, consistently 
with the previous report, in disease samples dramatic immune cells infiltration 
was found, among which a proximal tubule (PT) subset characterized by wnt-β 
catenin activation and a natural killer T (NKT) subset high expressing LTB were 
found. Furthermore, in the cluster of the podocyte, three glomerulonephritis 
related genes named FXYD5, CD74 and B2M were found. Compared with the mesangial 
of donor, the gene CLIC1 and RPS26 were up-regulated in mesangial of IgA 
nephropathy(IgAN), whereas the gene JUNB was up-regulated in podocyte of IgAN in 
comparison with that of donor. Meanwhile, some membranous nephropathy (MN) high 
expressed genes such as HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA2, IFNG, CCL2 and NR4A2, which involve 
in highest enrichment pathway, display the cellular-specific expression style, 
whereas monocyte marker of lupus nephritis (LN) named TNFSF13B was also found 
and interferon alpha/beta signalling pathway was enriched in B and NKT of LN 
comparing with donor. By scRNA-seq, we first defined the podocyte markers of 
glomerulonephritis and specific markers in IgA, MN and LN were found at cellular 
level. Furthermore, the critical role of interferon alpha/beta signalling 
pathway was enriched in B and NKT of LN was declared.

BACKGROUND: Unlike bone tissue, little progress has been made regarding 
cartilage regeneration, and many challenges remain. Furthermore, the key roles 
of cartilage lesion caused by traumas, focal lesion, or articular overstress 
remain unclear. Traumatic injuries to the meniscus as well as its degeneration 
are important risk factors for long-term joint dysfunction, degenerative joint 
lesions, and knee osteoarthritis (OA) a chronic joint disease characterized by 
degeneration of articular cartilage and hyperosteogeny. Nearly 50% of the 
individuals with meniscus injuries develop OA over time. Due to the limited 
inherent self-repair capacity of cartilage lesion, the Biomaterial 
drug-nanomedicine is considered to be a promising alternative. Therefore, it is 
important to elucidate the gene potential regeneration mechanisms and discover 
novel precise medication, which are identified through this study to investigate 
their function and role in pathogenesis.
METHODS: We downloaded the mRNA microarray statistics GSE117999, involving 
paired cartilage lesion tissue samples from 12 OA patients and 12 patients from 
a control group. First, we analyzed these statistics to recognize the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We then exposed the gene ontology (GO) 
annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
enrichment analyses for these DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
were then constructed, from which we attained eight significant genes after a 
functional interaction analysis. Finally, we identified a potential nanomedicine 
attained from this assay set, using a wide range of inhibitor information 
archived in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) 
database.
RESULTS: Sixty-six DEGs were identified with our standards for meaning (adjusted 
P-value < 0.01, |log2 - FC| ≥1.2). Furthermore, we identified eight hub genes 
and one potential nanomedicine - Selenocysteine based on these integrative data.
CONCLUSION: We identified eight hub genes that could work as prospective 
biomarkers for the diagnostic and biomaterial drug treatment of cartilage 
lesion, involving the novel genes CAMP, DEFA3, TOLLIP, HLA-DQA2, SLC38A6, 
SLC3A1, FAM20A, and ANO8. Meanwhile, these genes were mainly associated with 
immune response, immune mediator induction, and cell chemotaxis. Significant 
support is provided for obtaining a series of novel gene targets, and we 
identify potential mechanisms for cartilage regeneration and final nanomedicine 
immunotherapy in regenerative medicine.

We elucidated the molecular cross-talk between cartilage and synovium in 
osteoarthritis, the most widespread arthritis in the world, using the powerful 
tool of single-cell RNA-sequencing. Multiple cell types were identified based on 
profiling of 10,640 synoviocytes and 26,192 chondrocytes: 12 distinct synovial 
cell types and 7 distinct articular chondrocyte phenotypes from matched tissues. 
Intact cartilage was enriched for homeostatic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, 
while damaged cartilage was enriched for prefibro- and fibro-, regulatory, 
reparative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. A total of 61 cytokines and growth 
factors were predicted to regulate the 7 chondrocyte cell phenotypes. Based on 
production by > 1% of cells, 55% of the cytokines were produced by synovial 
cells (39% exclusive to synoviocytes and not expressed by chondrocytes) and 
their presence in osteoarthritic synovial fluid confirmed. The synoviocytes 
producing IL-1beta (a classic pathogenic cytokine in osteoarthritis), mainly 
inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells, were characterized by 
co-expression of surface proteins corresponding to HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, OLR1 or 
TLR2. Strategies to deplete these pathogenic intra-articular cell subpopulations 
could be a therapeutic option for human osteoarthritis.

Background and objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory 
disease of the central nervous system, leading to demyelination of neurons and 
potentially debilitating physical and mental symptoms. The disease is more 
prevalent in women than in men. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
region has been identified as a major genetic determinant for autoimmune 
diseases, and its role in some neurological disorders including MS was 
evaluated. An intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9275596, 
located between the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 genes, is in significant association 
with various autoimmune diseases according to genome-wide association studies 
(GWASs). A cumulative effect of this SNP with other polymorphisms from this 
region was revealed. The aim of the study was to verify the data on rs9275596 
association in multiple sclerosis in a case/control study of the Latvian 
population and to evaluate eventual functional significance of allele 
substitutions. Materials and Methods: rs9275596 (chr6:32713854; GRCh38.p12) was 
genotyped in 273 MS patients and 208 controls on main and sex-specific 
associations. Eventual functional significance of allele substitutions was 
evaluated in silico using publicly available tools. Results: The rs9275596 rare 
alleles were identified as a disease susceptibility factor in association with 
the MS main group and in affected females (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, 
respectively). Risk factor genotypes with rare alleles included were associated 
with the MS common cohort (p < 0.002) and female cohort (odds ratio, OR = 2.24) 
and were identified as disease susceptible in males (OR = 2.41). It was shown 
that structural changes of rs9275596 affect the secondary structure of DNA. 
Functional significance of allele substitutions was evaluated on the eventual 
sequence affinity to transcription factors (TFs) and splicing signals 
similarity. A possible impact of the particular polymorphisms on the 
transcription and splicing efficiency is discussed. Conclusions: Our results 
suggest susceptibility of rs9275596 to multiple sclerosis in Latvians.
