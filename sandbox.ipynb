      "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Numerous genome-wide association studies have been performed to \n",
      "understand the influence of genetic variation on type 2 diabetes etiology. Many \n",
      "identified risk variants are located in non-coding and intergenic regions, which \n",
      "complicates understanding of how genes and their downstream pathways are \n",
      "influenced. An integrative data approach will help to understand the mechanism \n",
      "and consequences of identified risk variants.\n",
      "METHODS: In the current study we use our previously developed method CONQUER to \n",
      "overlap 403 type 2 diabetes risk variants with regulatory, expression and \n",
      "protein data to identify tissue-shared disease-relevant mechanisms.\n",
      "RESULTS: One SNP rs474513 was found to be an expression-, protein- and \n",
      "metabolite QTL. Rs474513 influenced LPA mRNA and protein levels in the pancreas \n",
      "and plasma, respectively. On the pathway level, in investigated tissues most \n",
      "SNPs linked to metabolism. However, in eleven of the twelve tissues investigated \n",
      "nine SNPs were linked to differential expression of the ribosome pathway. \n",
      "Furthermore, seven SNPs were linked to altered expression of genes linked to the \n",
      "immune system. Among them, rs601945 was found to influence multiple HLA genes, \n",
      "including HLA-DQA2, in all twelve tissues investigated.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our results show that in addition to the classical metabolism \n",
      "pathways, other pathways may be important to type 2 diabetes that show a \n",
      "potential overlap with type 1 diabetes.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Although genome-wide association studies have been conducted to \n",
      "investigate genetic variation of lung tumorigenesis, little is known about \n",

      "METHODS: Leveraging a total of 445,221 European-descent participants from the \n",
      "International Lung Cancer Consortium OncoArray project, Transdisciplinary \n",
      "Research in Cancer of the Lung and UK Biobank, we performed a large-scale \n",
      "genome-wide G × G interaction study on European NSCLC risk by a series of \n",
      "analyses. First, we used BiForce to evaluate and rank more than 58 billion G × G \n",
      "interactions from 340,958 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Then, the top \n",
      "interactions were further tested by demographically adjusted logistic regression \n",

      "screening models of NSCLC, separately, for never and ever smokers.\n",
